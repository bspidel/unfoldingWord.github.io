The **Unlocked Greek Lexicon** is:

  - **Free of copyright and licensing restrictions** (public domain / CC0), permitting the entire global Church to use and build on it without hindrance.
  - **Based on existing work** of excellent pedigree and academic repute.
  - **Translated** into all the [Gateway Languages][gl] of the world, and any other language in which the Church desires to have a Greek lexicon.

The project is online at: <https://github.com/unfoldingWord/Unlocked-Greek-Lexicon>
