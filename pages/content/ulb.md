The Unlocked Literal Bible is an open-licensed version of the Bible that is intended to provide a "form-centric" understanding of the Bible. It attempts to increase the translator's understanding of the lexical and grammatical composition of the underlying text by adhering closely to the word order and structure of the originals.

The Unlocked Literal Bible is intended to be used together with the [Unlocked Dynamic Bible][udb] to provide a more robust view of both the form and function of the original texts.

You may browse the [unfoldingWord Bible Web App](https://bible.unfoldingword.org/) or see all the versions on [Github](https://github.com/unfoldingWord/ulb-en/releases).
