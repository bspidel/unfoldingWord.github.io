## About the book

Only in the last 100 years has world missions been built on a foundation
of “all rights reserved.” This model is both legal and ethical, but it has
limited reach. The missions task is immense, and millions of people in
thousands of people groups are still waiting to receive even one
biblical resource in their own language.

**There is another way to equip the global church for spiritual
growth.** Christians all over the world can use 21st century technology
to openly collaborate in the creation of unrestricted biblical content
in any language. These unrestricted biblical resources—the Christian
Commons—can be legally translated, adapted, built on, revised,
redistributed, and used, by anyone, without hindrance, *today*.
Unrestricted biblical resources can reach more people, in less time,
with less expense, more effectively.



> Everyone who believed was of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but **they had everything in common**... *and there was not a needy person among them*. —Acts 4:32,34
