Everyone
--------

Without exception, the Church in every people group will have adequate 
biblical content in their own language.

> And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth
> has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all people
> groups, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
> the Holy Spirit” —Matthew 28:19


Excellence
----------

Above all else, we strive for excellence in everything we do.

> Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who
> has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. —2
> Timothy 2:15


Unstoppable
-----------

We believe God will be glorified through a movement of Bible translation 
in every language that cannot be repressed.

> After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could
> number, from every people group, from all tribes and peoples and
> languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in
> white robes, with palm branches in their hands. —Revelation 7:9


Distinctive Features
====================

The unfoldingWord project is committed to these things:

-  **always open** — everything we create is made available under a license that irrevocably grants the entire Church unrestricted freedom. (Acts 4:32)
-  **biblically faithful** — we are committed to clear and accurate communication of God’s Word in every culture.
-  **quality media** — we enable the Church to produce media of the best possible quality that meets their needs.
-  **accessible** — all content is freely available and redistributable in suitable formats.
-  **Church-centric** — we seek to serve the Church in every people group by equipping them for perpetual, self-sufficient translation of biblical content with excellence.
