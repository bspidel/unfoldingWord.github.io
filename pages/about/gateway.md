The objective of the gateway languages strategy is to equip 100% of
the people groups that comprise the global Church with biblical content
that is released from copyright restrictions and made available in a
language they understand well (a language of wider communication)
together with unrestricted translation training and tools that enable
them to translate it into a language they understand fully (their own
language). A “gateway language” is a language of wider communication
through which second-language speakers of that language can gain access
to content and translate it into their own language.

-   The “gateway languages” at the world level comprise the smallest
    number of languages through which content can be delivered to every
    other language, via translation by bilingual speakers. *For example,
    French is a gateway language for minority languages in Francophone
    Africa in that content available in French can be translated by
    bilingual speakers from French into their own languages.*

-   At the country level, the gateway languages of a given country are
    the fewest languages of wider communication required for bilingual
    speakers in every minority language native to the country (not
    located there due to immigration) to gain access to content. *For
    example, English is the gateway language for North Korea, given that
    all people groups native to North Korea can be reached by
    translation of content into their language from English.*

-   The route that content travels from it’s source language to every
    other language may include more than one “intermediate
    gateway.” *For example, source content in English en route to
    minority languages in southern Afghanistan may go from English to
    Persian to Dari to the receptor language.*

-   The route through which content gets from one language another is
    theoretically different for every source language. *For example, the
    route between intermediate gateways for source content in French to
    get to every other language would be different than source content
    in English. we are primarily focused on source content in English.*
    
-   Currently, there are 51 known gateway languages. Research is still 
    ongoing to determine the accurate number of gateway languages, please
