The objective of the gateway languages strategy is to equip 100% of
the people groups that comprise the global Church with biblical content
that is released from copyright restrictions and made available in a
language they understand well (a language of wider communication)
together with unrestricted translation training and tools that enable
them to translate it into a language they understand fully (their own
language). A “gateway language” is a language of wider communication
through which second-language speakers of that language can gain access
to content and translate it into their own language.

  - The “gateway languages” at the world level comprise the smallest
    number of languages of wider communication through which content 
    can be delivered to every
    other language, via translation by bilingual speakers. *For example,
    French is a gateway language for minority languages in Francophone
    Africa in that content available in French can be translated by
    bilingual speakers from French into their own languages.*

  - At the country level, the gateway languages of a given country are
    the fewest languages of wider communication required for bilingual
    speakers in every minority language native to the country (not
    located there due to immigration) to gain access to content. *For
    example, English is the gateway language for North Korea, given that
    all people groups native to North Korea can be reached by
    translation of content into their language from English.*

  - The route that content travels from its source language to every
    other language may include more than one “intermediate
    gateway.” *For example, source content in English en route to
    minority languages in southern Afghanistan may go from English to
    Persian to Dari to the receptor language.*

  - The route through which content gets from one language another is
    theoretically different for every source language. *For example, the
    route between intermediate gateways for source content in French to
    get to every other language would be different than source content
    in English. we are primarily focused on source content in English.*

The Gateway Languages
---------------------

Currently, there are **49** known gateway languages, with as many as 8 
additional variants (note that due to their different characteristics, 
Sign Languages are not covered in this strategy). Research is still 
[ongoing](#ongoing-research) to determine the complete number of gateway 
languages. Please [contact us][contact] if you have updated information. 
Thank you!

Ongoing Research
----------------

The identification of the gateway languages is an ongoing research project. 
Known areas where input is needed include:

**South Asia:** 

  - Are any of the gateway languages listed for India unnecessary? 
  - Should any languages be added to the list to cover all of India, including 
    any of the following (also official languages in India): Konkani (koi), 
	Manipuri (mmi), Khasi (kha), Mizo (lus), Lotha (njh)? 

**Eurasia:**

  - What languages have Dominant Culture Variants (see the 
    [glossary][glossary])?
  - What are the gateway languages in the following countries: Turkmenistan, 
    Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan?
  - For each of these countries, what are the sociolinguistic implications of 
    using Russian as a gateway language, given the historical and political 
	connotations? 
  - What are the gateway languages used in Afghanistan? Should Pashto be considered a gateway language in Afghanistan? 
  - Is Kurdish a gateway language for any people groups speaking minority 
    languages in Central Asia (or elsewhere)?

**Pacific:**

  - How many gateway languages are in use in Indonesia?
