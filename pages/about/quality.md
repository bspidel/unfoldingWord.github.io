We use a three-level, Church-centric approach for identifying the fidelity of translated Biblical content:

![uW - Level 1]({{ '/assets/img/uW-Level1-64px.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
{: .one-third .first}

**Level 1: internal** — Translator (or team) affirms that translation is in line with [Statement of Faith][faith] and
[Translation Guidelines][guidelines].
{: .two-thirds}
 
 
![uW - Level 2]({{ '/assets/img/uW-Level2-64px.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
{: .one-third .first}

**Level 2: external** — Translation is independently checked and confirmed by the language community as well as three church leaders not on the translation team.
{: .two-thirds}
 
 
![uW - Level 3]({{ '/assets/img/uW-Level3-64px.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
{: .one-third .first}

**Level 3: authenticated** — Translation is checked and confirmed by leadership of at least three Church networks with native speakers of the language, or a translation consultant in coordination with a Church network.
{: .two-thirds}

This model is explained in greater detail below and in the whitepaper "[Quality Assurance of Open-Licensed Biblical Content][qa-doc]" (current document revision: **{{ 'qa-pdf'|rev }}**).

##Checking Levels, Explained


The three-level checking scale we use is dependent on the unfoldingWord
[Statement of Faith][faith] and [Translation Guidelines][guidelines]. All translated content is compared against the theology of
the Statement of Faith and against the procedures and methodologies of
the Translation Guidelines. With these documents forming the foundation,
these are the three levels of checking used in the unfoldingWord
project:


### Checking Level 1: Internal Check

-   The translator (or team) asserts that the Statement of Faith is an
    accurate reflection of their own beliefs and that the translated
    content is also in harmony with it.

-   The translator (or team) asserts that the translated content has
    been done in accordance with the Translation Guidelines and that
    they have made full use of available exegetical and translation
    checking resources in the translation process.

-   The translator (or team) is in personal contact with at least one
    element of the unfoldingWord network.

-   For the purposes of the unfoldingWord project, translations of Bible
    texts are only published once they achieve Level 2. Other biblical
    content is made available at Level 1.

-   *This enables the broadest reach of the content as an active
    project, with an open invitation (implied or direct) to help
    improve the translation.*


### Checking Level 2: External Check

-   The content has been comprehensively reviewed by members of the
    language community using comprehension questions to make sure that
    it is clear, natural, and understandable.

    -   The community members who do the review should not have worked
        on the translation themselves, and they should be
        representative of the language area. If there are differences
        of dialect or vocabulary across the language group that will
        be served by the translation, then the reviewers should
        include representatives of the different dialects.

    -   The community reviewers should include a spectrum of age groups and both men and women. It is helpful if the reviewers include both believers and non-believers, or at least believers who are relatively unfamiliar with the Bible so that they do not know what the text is supposed to say before they hear it. 

-   The translation has been checked by a group of church leaders from
    the language community to make sure that it is accurate.

    -   This group must consist of at least three church leaders who are
        native speakers of the target language, and at least one of
        which understands well one of the languages in which the
        source text is available.

    -   They should not be related to, or otherwise closely connected
        with, the translator (or translation team). Usually, these
        reviewers will be pastors of church congregations.

    -   These church leaders should represent the different churches in
        the language community. That is, they must not be from the
        same church network, but must be from three different church
        networks that are in agreement with the Statement of Faith and
        Translation Guidelines, if the community has that many.

-   As in Level 1, the translated content is compared to the Statement
    of Faith and Translation Guidelines and the checkers assert that
    the translated content conforms to both.

-   *This implements the concept of a “testimony of two or three
    witnesses” in the checking process.*


### Checking Level 3: Authenticated Check


There are two tracks by which content can achieve level 3.

-   **Track 1:**

    -   The first track is completed when the content has been
        thoroughly checked by at least three separate Church networks.

    -   Those checking the translation must be first-language speakers
        of the language, and those signing off on the check must be
        leaders of the Church networks.

    -   A leader of a Church network who is also a first language
        speaker of the language of the translation may both check the
        translation and sign off on its quality.

    -   Level 3 in this track is thus achieved by the mutual agreement
        of multiple elements of the Church internal.

-   **Track 2:**

    -   The second track is completed when the content has been
        thoroughly checked by an accountable entity in the
        unfoldingWord network that has training and experience in
        checking translated biblical content, as well as by a Church
        network with first-language speakers of the language (as
        described in the first track).

    -   Level 3 in this track is thus achieved by the mutual agreement
        of the Church internal and the Church global, as represented
        by the accountable entity.

		*Note: Entities such as translation organizations and church
		denominations can be part of the unfoldingWord network, given that
		they agree with the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines and
		that they are publicly accountable in some way to constituents who are
		part of the Church (including donors, members, etc.). Based on the
		strength of the trust relationship between entities, the unfoldingWord
		network can grow rapidly and it becomes self-reinforcing as multiple
		nodes connect to each other.*

-   In either track, the checking entities must have a track record that
    does not contradict their assertion that they adhere to the
    Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines.

-   *This implements a “by their fruit you will know them” component.*

As translated content is checked by more people, using freely-available
resources and following the established doctrinal and procedural
guidelines for the unfoldingWord project, the content is iteratively
improved and checked to increasingly higher levels of quality. The
checked translations are made available in the
unfoldingWord “catalog” of available content and labeled according to
the checking level.

The approximate degree of rigor in each level of checking should not be
considered to be linear in nature. Instead, the degree of rigor
increases significantly from one level to the next. The
scale describes an open standard that can provide
clarity regarding the degree of checking to both the Church internal to
the people group as well as external.
