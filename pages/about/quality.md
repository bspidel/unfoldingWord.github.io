We use a three-level, Church-centric approach for identifying the fidelity of translated Biblical content:

![uW - Level 1]({{ '/assets/img/uW-Level1-64px.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
{: .one-third .first}

**Level 1: internal** — Translator (or team) affirms that translation is in line with [Statement of Faith](/faith) and
[Translation Guidelines]({{ '/guidelines' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
{: .two-thirds}
 
 
![uW - Level 2]({{ '/assets/img/uW-Level2-64px.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
{: .one-third .first}

**Level 2: external** — Translation is independently checked and confirmed by three church leaders not on the translation team.
{: .two-thirds}
 
 
![uW - Level 3]({{ '/assets/img/uW-Level3-64px.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
{: .one-third .first}

**Level 3: authenticated** — Translation is checked and confirmed by leadership of at least three Church networks with
native speakers of the language, or a translation consultant in coordination with a Church network.
{: .two-thirds}

This model is explained in greater detail in the whitepaper "[Quality Assurance of Open-Licensed Biblical Content]({{ '/assets/docs/whitepapers/Quality Assurance of Open-Licensed Biblical Content-rev 14.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }})".
