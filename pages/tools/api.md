The unfoldingWord web API uses a simple flat file structure that is available at: <https://api.unfoldingword.org>. Translated biblical content is available in multiple formats, including:

  -  **JSON** -- the unfoldingWord catalog lists all available content in all available language in JSON format.
  -  **HTML** -- content is made available for web publishing as HTML.
  -  **PDF** -- content is also rendered as PDFs suitable for print-on-demand and on-device reading (in progress).
  -  **online Scripture** -- Bible translations are web-published directly from the catalog (in progress). 

Learn more by reading the [API README](https://api.unfoldingword.org/README.html).
