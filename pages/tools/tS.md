biblical content into any language.  The purpose of
translationStudio is to make Bible translation accessible to the global
church.  translationStudio is fully functional without an internet connection
and enables collaboration in the translation process.  The app includes
numerous just in time translation helps that explain keywords, difficult to
translate phrases, and general translation concepts.  When translations are
completed, the app enables uploading and publishing through the unfoldingWord
platform.
