          <ol>
            <li><strong>Accurate</strong> — Translate accurately, without detracting from, changing, or adding to the
              meaning of the original text. Translated content should faithfully communicate as precisely as possible
              the meaning of the original text as it would have been understood by the original audience.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Clear</strong> — Use whatever language structures are necessary to achieve the highest level of
              comprehension. This includes rearranging the form of a text and using as many or as few terms as necessary
              to communicate the original meaning as accurately as possible.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Faithful</strong> — Use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical
              languages. Terms addressing the relationship between God the Father and God the Son should be retained in
              translated content and clarified, as needed, in footnotes or other supplemental resources.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Authoritative</strong> — Use the original language biblical texts as the highest authority for
              translation of biblical content. Reliable biblical content in other languages may be used for
              clarification and as intermediary source texts.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Pure</strong> — Avoid any political, denominational, ideological, social, cultural, or
              theological bias in your translation.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Expressive</strong> — Communicate the feelings and attitudes of the original text. As much as
              possible, maintain the literary forms in the original text, including narrative, poetry, exhortation, and
              prophecy, representing them with corresponding forms that communicate in a similar way in your language.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Historical</strong> — Communicate historical events and facts accurately, providing additional
              information as needed in order to accurately communicate the intended message to people who do not share
              the same context and culture as the original recipients of the original content.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Natural</strong> — Use language forms that are effective and that reflect the way your language
              is used in corresponding contexts.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Collaborative</strong> — Where possible, work together with other believers who speak your
              language to translate, check, and distribute the translated content, ensuring that it is of the highest
              quality and available to as many people as possible.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ongoing</strong> — Encourage the periodic review of translations to ascertain when revision or a
              new translation is needed.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Managing and Identifying Translation Quality</h2>

          <p>The quality of a translation generally refers to the fidelity of the translation to the meaning of the
            original, and the degree to which the translation is understandable and effective for the speakers of the
            receptor language. The strategy we suggest involves checking the forms and communicative quality of the
            translation with the language community, and checking the fidelity of the translation with the Church in
            that people group.</p>

          <p>The specific steps involved may vary significantly, depending on the language and context of the
            translation project. Generally, we consider a good translation to be one that is:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Accurate</strong> &#8211; Faithful to the intended meaning of the original, as determined by the
              Church in that people group and in alignment with the Church global and historical, and consequently:
            </li>
            <li><strong>Affirmed by the Church</strong> &#8211; Endorsed and used by the Church.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>In addition, a good translation is reviewed by the speakers of the language community and is found to
            be:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Natural</strong> &#8211; Using current forms of the language, and</li>
            <li><strong>Clear</strong> &#8211; Strives for the highest level of comprehension by hearers.</li>
          </ol>
