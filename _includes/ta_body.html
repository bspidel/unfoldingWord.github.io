<h1 id="ta_intro">Introduction to translationAcademy</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is translationAcademy?</p>
<p>Welcome to translationAcademy</p>
<p>The “translationAcademy” is intended to enable anyone, anywhere to equip themselves so that they will be able to translate Biblical content into their own language. The goal of translationAcademy is to teach how to do a high-quality, meaning-based translation (see the <a href="#translate_manual">Translation Manual</a>), how to check a translation to ensure it is clear, accurate, natural, and equal (see the <a href="#intro_checking">Checking Manual</a>), and how to use the technology tools we have created (see the <a href="#toc_techvol1">Technology Manual</a>). <br></p>
<p>translationAcademy is intended to be highly flexible. It can be used in a systematic, in-advance approach or it can be used for just-in-time learning (or both, as needed). It is modular in structure. These modules have been grouped as follows:</p>
<p><a href="#uw_intro">Introduction</a> - introduces the unfoldingWord project<br></p>
<p><a href="#translate_manual">Translation Manual</a> - explains how to translate<br></p>
<p><a href="#intro_checking">Checker's Manual</a> - explains how to check a translation<br></p>
<p><a href="#toc_techvol1">Technology Manual Volume 1</a> and <a href="#toc_techvol2">Technology Manual Volume 2</a> - explain how to use the different technology tools<br></p>
<p>Next we recommend you learn about: <a href="#uw_intro">The unfoldingWord Project</a><br></p>


<h1 id="uw_intro">The unfoldingWord Project</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is the unfoldingWord Project?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#ta_intro">Introduction to translationAcademy</a><br></p>
<p>This section explains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why the unfoldingWord project exists and why we do what we do</li>
<li>How we go about trying to accomplish that goal</li>
<li>What we do to meet that goal</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>Jesus commanded his disciples to make disciples of EVERY people group:</p>
<blockquote>"Jesus came to them and spoke to them and said, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations. Baptize them into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Teach them to obey all the things that I have commanded you. And see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.” -Matthew 28:18-20 (ULB)</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>We have the promise that one day representatives from EVERY language will be in heaven:</p>
<blockquote>“After these things I saw, and behold, there was a great crowd, which no one was able to number, out of every nation, tribe, people, and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. ” -Revelation 7:9 (ULB)</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>Understanding the WORD OF GOD in one's heart language is so important:</p>
<blockquote>"So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ." -Romans 10:17 (ULB)</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>Why do we do what we do?</p>
<p>The unfoldingWord project exists because every people group deserves to have the Word of God in their language. To this end we seek to make disciples of all nations by helping to provide <strong>unrestricted biblical content in every language of the world</strong>.</p>
<h3>How</h3>
<p>How do we accomplish our goal of <strong>unrestricted biblical content in every language</strong>?</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Next we recommend you learn about: <a href="#statement_of_faith">Statement of Faith</a><br></p>


<h1 id="statement_of_faith">Statement of Faith</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What do we believe?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#uw_intro">The unfoldingWord Project</a><br></p>
<h1>Statement of Faith</h1>
<p><em>The following statement of faith is subscribed to by all member organizations of and contributors to the <a href="http://unfoldingword.org">unfoldingWord</a> project. It is in agreement with the <a href="http://www.lausanne.org/en/documents/lausanne-covenant.html">Lausanne Covenant</a>.</em><br></p>
<p>We believe that Christian belief can and should be divided into <strong>essential beliefs</strong> and <strong>peripheral beliefs</strong>.</p>
<h3>Essential beliefs</h3>
<p>Essential beliefs are what define a follower of Jesus Christ and can never be compromised or ignored.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We believe the Bible to be the only inspired, inerrant, sufficient, authoritative Word of God.</p></li>
<li><p>We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son and the Holy Spirit.</p></li>
<li><p>We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>We believe in the humanity of Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father.</p></li>
<li><p>We believe that every person is inherently sinful and so is deserving of eternal hell.</p></li>
<li><p>We believe that salvation from sin is a gift of God, provided through the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, attained by grace through faith, not by works.</p></li>
<li><p>We believe that true faith is always accompanied by repentance and regeneration by the Holy Spirit.</p></li>
<li><p>We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the follower of Jesus Christ is enabled to live a godly life.</p></li>
<li><p>We believe in the spiritual unity of all believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, from all nations and languages and people groups.</p></li>
<li><p>We believe in the personal and physical return of Jesus Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; the unsaved will be resurrected to eternal damnation in hell and the saved will be resurrected to eternal blessing in heaven with God.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Peripheral beliefs</h3>
<p>Peripheral beliefs are everything else that is in Scripture but about which sincere followers of Christ may disagree (e.g. Baptism, Lord's Supper, the Rapture, etc.). We choose to agree to disagree agreeably on these topics and press on together toward a common goal of making disciples of every people group (Matthew 28:18-20) .</p>
<p>Next we recommend you learn about: <a href="#translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</a><br></p>


<h1 id="translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: By what principles do we translate?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#uw_intro">The unfoldingWord Project</a><br></li>
<li><a href="#translate_manual">Introduction to Translation Manual</a><br></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The following statement on the principles and procedures used in translation is subscribed to by all member organizations of and contributors to the <a href="http://unfoldingword.org">unfoldingWord</a> (http://unfoldingword.org) project. All translation activities are carried out according to these common guidelines.</em><br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accurate</strong> — Translate accurately, without detracting from, changing, or adding to the meaning of the original text. Translated content should faithfully communicate as precisely as possible the meaning of the original text as it would have been understood by the original audience. See <a href="#guidelines_accurate">Create Accurate Translations</a> for more information.<br></li>
<li><strong>Faithful</strong> — Avoid any political, denominational, ideological, social, cultural, or theological bias in your translation. Use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. Use equivalent common language terms for the biblical words that describe the relationship between God the Father and God the Son. These may be clarified, as needed, in footnotes or other supplemental resources. See <a href="#guidelines_faithful">en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_faithful</a> and <a href="#guidelines_pure">en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_pure</a> for more information.<br></li>
<li><strong>Authoritative</strong> — Use the original language biblical texts as the highest authority for translation of biblical content. Reliable biblical content in other languages may be used for clarification and as intermediary source texts. See <a href="#guidelines_authoritative">en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_authoritative</a> for more information.<br></li>
<li><strong>Historical</strong> — Communicate historical events and facts accurately, providing additional information as needed in order to accurately communicate the intended message to people who do not share the same context and culture as the original recipients of the original content. See the (7 min. long) lesson on <strong><em>Translating the Scriptures - Culture</em></strong> for the <a href="http://youtu.be/9nLRLAgOIpw">computer</a> (http://youtu.be/9nLRLAgOIpw) and the <a href="http://youtu.be/girNfacETDE">tablet</a> (http://youtu.be/girNfacETDE). See <a href="#guidelines_historical">en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_historical</a> for more information.<br></li>
<li><strong>Clear</strong> — Use whatever language structures are necessary to achieve the highest level of comprehension. This includes rearranging the form of a text and using as many or as few terms as necessary to communicate the original meaning as accurately as possible. See <a href="#guidelines_clear">Create Clear Translations</a> for more information. <br></li>
<li><strong>Natural</strong> — Use language forms that are effective and that reflect the way your language is used in corresponding contexts. See <a href="#guidelines_natural">Create Natural Translations</a> for more information.<br></li>
<li><strong>Equal</strong> — Communicate the same intent as the source text, including expressions of feeling and attitudes. As much as possible, maintain the different kinds of literature in the original text, including narrative, poetry, exhortation, and prophecy, representing them with corresponding forms that communicate in a similar way in your language. See <a href="#guidelines_equal">Equal Translations</a> for more information.<br></li>
</ul>
<h1>Managing and Identifying Translation Quality</h1>
<p>The quality of a translation generally refers to the fidelity of the translation to the meaning of the original, and the degree to which the translation is understandable and effective for the speakers of the receptor language. The strategy we suggest involves checking the forms and communicative quality of the translation with the language community, and checking the fidelity of the translation with the Church in that people group.</p>
<p>The specific steps involved may vary significantly, depending on the language and context of the translation project. Generally, we consider a good translation to be one that has been reviewed by the speakers of the language community and also by the leadership of the church in the language group so that it is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Accurate, Clear, Natural, and Equal</strong> — Faithful to the intended meaning of the original, as determined by the Church in that people group and in alignment with the Church global and historical, and consequently:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Affirmed by the Church</strong> - Endorsed and used by the Church.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We also recommend that the translation work be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaborative</strong> — Where possible, work together with other believers who speak your language to translate, check, and distribute the translated content, ensuring that it is of the highest quality and available to as many people as possible. See <a href="#guidelines_collaborative">en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_collaborative</a> for more information.<br></li>
<li><strong>Ongoing</strong> — Translation work is never completely finished. Encourage those who are skilled with the language to suggest better ways to say things when they notice that improvements can be made. Any errors in the translation should also be corrected as soon as they are discovered. Also encourage the periodic review of translations to ascertain when revision or a new translation is needed. We recommend that each language community form a translation committee to oversee this ongoing work. Using the unfoldingWord online tools, these changes to the translation can be made quickly and easily. See <a href="#guidelines_ongoing">en:ta:vol2:translate:guidelines_ongoing</a> for more information.<br></li>

<p>Next we recommend you learn about: <a href="#gl_strategy">Gateway Languages Strategy</a><br></p>


<h1 id="gl_strategy">Gateway Languages Strategy</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How can every language be reached?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#uw_intro">The unfoldingWord Project</a><br></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>The objective of the gateway languages strategy is to equip 100% of the people groups that comprise the global Church with biblical content that is released from copyright restrictions and made available in a language they understand well (a language of wider communication) together with unrestricted translation training and tools that enable them to translate it into a language they understand fully (their own language). A “gateway language” is a language of wider communication through which second-language speakers of that language can gain access to content and translate it into their own language.</p>
<p>The “gateway languages” at the world level comprise the smallest number of languages through which content can be delivered to every other language, via translation by bilingual speakers. For example, French is a gateway language for minority languages in Francophone Africa in that content available in French can be translated by bilingual speakers from French into their own languages.</p>
<p>At the country level, the gateway languages of a given country are the fewest languages of wider communication required for bilingual speakers in every minority language native to the country (not located there due to immigration) to gain access to content. For example, English is the gateway language for North Korea, given that all people groups native to North Korea can be reached by translation of content into their language from English.</p>
<p>To read more about the Gateway Languages Strategy and to find out if your language is a gateway language, click <a href="https://unfoldingword.org/gateway/">here</a>. <br></p>
<h3>Effects</h3>
<p>This model has two basic effects: First, it empowers all languages to &quot;pull&quot; content to their language once the content and helps have been &quot;pushed&quot; into a language accessible to every language of the world (a gateway language). Second, it limits the amount of translation that needs to be done as the helps only have to be translated into the gateway language. All other languages can translate only the content as no language will be dependent upon them for understanding the translation helps.</p>
<p>Thus, depending on whether or not a language is a gateway language will determine what needs to be translated into that language.</p>
<p>For Other Languages, we recommend they translate at least Open Bible Stories. They are welcome to translate whatever other resources they like.</p>
<p>For Gateway Languages, we strongly recommend the following resources be translated, in this order and checked to the level specified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>translationAcademy vol 1 - Level 2</p></li>
<li><p>Door43 Critical pages - Level 2</p></li>
<li><p>Open Bible Stories</p>

<h1 id="checking_levels">Checking Levels</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What are the Checking Levels?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#gl_strategy">Gateway Languages Strategy</a><br></p>
<h3>Checking Levels, Explained</h3>
<p>Note: The final version of the Checking Levels is always located at https://unfoldingword.org/quality/</p>
<p>The three-level checking scale we use is dependent on the unfoldingWord <a href="#statement_of_faith">Statement of Faith</a> and <a href="#translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</a>. All translated content is compared against the theology of the Statement of Faith and against the procedures and methodologies of the Translation Guidelines. With these documents forming the foundation, these are the three levels of checking used in the unfoldingWord project:<br></p>
<h4>Checking Level 1: Internal Check</h4>
<ul>
<li>The translator (or team) asserts that the Statement of Faith is an accurate reflection of their own beliefs and that the translated content is also in harmony with it.</li>
<li>The translator (or team) asserts that the translated content has been done in accordance with the Translation Guidelines and that they have made full use of available exegetical and translation checking resources in the translation process.</li>
<li>The translator (or team) is in personal contact with at least one element of the unfoldingWord network.</li>
<li>For the purposes of the unfoldingWord project, translations of Bible texts are only published once they achieve Level 2. Other biblical content is made available at Level 1.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This enables the broadest reach of the content as an active project, with an open invitation (implied or direct) to help improve the translation.</em></p>
<h4>Checking Level 2: External Check</h4>
<ul>
<li>The content has been comprehensively reviewed by members of the language community using comprehension questions to make sure that it is clear, natural, and understandable.
<ul>
<li>The community members who do the review should not have worked on the translation themselves, and they should be representative of the language area. If there are differences of dialect or vocabulary across the language group that will be served by the translation, then the reviewers should include representatives of the different dialects.</li>
<li>The community reviewers should include a spectrum of age groups and both men and women. It is helpful if the reviewers include both believers and non-believers, or at least believers who are relatively unfamiliar with the Bible so that they do not know what the text is supposed to say before they hear it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The translation has been checked by a group of church leaders from the language community to make sure that it is accurate.
<ul>
<li>This group must consist of at least three church leaders who are native speakers of the target language, and at least one of which understands well one of the languages in which the source text is available.</li>
<li>They should not be related to, or otherwise closely connected with, the translator (or translation team). Usually, these reviewers will be pastors of church congregations.</li>
<li>These church leaders should represent the different churches in the language community. That is, they must not be from the same church network, but must be from three different church networks that are in agreement with the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines, if the community has that many.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As in Level 1, the translated content is compared to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines and the checkers assert that the translated content conforms to both.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This implements the concept of a “testimony of two or three witnesses” in the checking process.</em></p>
<h4>Checking Level 3: Authenticated Check</h4>
<p>There are two tracks by which content can achieve level 3.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Track 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first track is completed when the content has been thoroughly checked by at least three separate Church networks.</li>
<li>Those checking the translation must be first-language speakers of the language, and those signing off on the check must be leaders of the Church networks.</li>
<li>A leader of a Church network who is also a first language speaker of the language of the translation may both check the translation and sign off on its quality.</li>
<li>Level 3 in this track is thus achieved by the mutual agreement of multiple elements of the Church internal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Track 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>The second track is completed when the content has been thoroughly checked by an accountable entity in the unfoldingWord network that has training and experience in checking translated biblical content, as well as by a Church network with first-language speakers of the language (as described in the first track).</li>
<li>Level 3 in this track is thus achieved by the mutual agreement of the Church internal and the Church global, as represented by the accountable entity.</li>
<li><em>Note: Entities such as translation organizations and church denominations can be part of the unfoldingWord network, given that they agree with the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines and that they are publicly accountable in some way to constituents who are part of the Church (including donors, members, etc.). Based on the strength of the trust relationship between entities, the unfoldingWord network can grow rapidly and it becomes self-reinforcing as multiple nodes connect to each other.</em> *In either track, the checking entities must have a track record that does not contradict their assertion that they adhere to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>This implements a “by their fruit you will know them” component.</em></p>
<p>As translated content is checked by more people, using freely-available resources and following the established doctrinal and procedural guidelines for the unfoldingWord project, the content is iteratively improved and checked to increasingly higher levels of quality. The checked translations are made available in the unfoldingWord “catalog” of available content and labeled according to the checking level.</p>
<p>The approximate degree of rigor in each level of checking should not be considered to be linear in nature. Instead, the degree of rigor increases significantly from one level to the next. The scale describes an open standard that can provide clarity regarding the degree of checking to both the Church internal to the people group as well as external.</p>

<h3>Translating the Text</h3>
<p>As you translate, be sure that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>pray that God would help you make an easily-understandable, Scripturally-accurate translation</li>
<li>translate everything that is in the source language</li>
<li>don't add anything that that is not necessary for comprehension</li>
<li>always do your translation according to the <a href="#translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</a><br></li>
<li>always do your translation according to the <a href="#statement_of_faith">Statement of Faith</a><br></li>
<li>use the translation notes and the explanations of important words to help you make a better translation.</li>

<h1 id="translate_terms">Terms to Know</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What terms should I know?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_manual">Introduction to Translation Manual</a><br></p>
<h5>These are terms that the Translation Manual will use to talk about language. The translator will need to understand these terms in order to use the Translation Manual.</h5>
<p><strong>Term</strong> - A word or phrase that refers to one thing, idea, or action. For example, the term in English for pouring liquid into one's mouth is &quot;drink.&quot; The term for a ceremony that marks an important transition in someone's life is &quot;rite of passage.&quot; The difference between a term and a word is that a term can contain several words.</p>
<p><strong>Text</strong> - A text is something that a speaker or writer is communicating to a hearer or reader by means of language. The speaker or writer has a certain meaning in mind, and so he or she chooses a form of the language to express that meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong> - The words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs surrounding the word, phrase, or sentence in question. The context is the text that surrounds the part of the text that you are examining. The meaning of individual words and phrases can change when they are in different contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Form</strong> - The structure of the language as it appears on the page or as it is spoken. &quot;Form&quot; refers to the way that the language is arranged - it includes the words, the word order, the grammar, idioms, and any other features of the structure of the text.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar</strong> - The way that sentences are put together in a language. This has to do with the order of its various parts, such as if the verb goes first or last or in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>Idiom</strong> - An expression that uses several words and that means something different as a whole than it would if the words were understood with the meanings that they have when they are used separately. Idioms cannot be translated literally, that is, with the meanings of the separate words. For example, &quot;He kicked the bucket&quot; is an idiom in English that means, &quot;He died.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong> - The underlying idea or concept that the text is trying to communicate to the reader or hearer. A speaker or writer can communicate the same meaning by using different forms of the language, and different people can understand different meanings from hearing or reading the same language form. In this way you can see that form and meaning are not the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong> - The act of expressing the meaning conveyed by the form of one language in the form of another language.</p>
<p><strong>Source Language</strong> - The language <em>from</em> which the translation is being made.</p>
<p><strong>Source Text</strong>- The text <em>from</em> which the translation is being made.</p>
<p><strong>Target Language</strong> - The language <em>into</em> which a translation is being made.</p>
<p><strong>Target Text</strong>- The text being made by the translator as he or she translates the meaning from the source text.</p>
<p><strong>Original Language</strong> - The language in which a Bible text was initially written. The Original Language of the New Testament is Greek. The Original Language of most of the Old Testament is Hebrew. However, the Original Language of some parts of Daniel and Ezra is Aramaic. The Original Language is always the most accurate language from which to translate a passage.</p>
<p><strong>Language of Wider Communication</strong> - A language that is spoken over a broad area and by many people. For most people, this is not their first language, but is the language that they use to speak to people outside of their language community. Some people call this a trade language. Most Bibles will be translated using a language of wider communication as the source language.</p>
<p><strong>Literal Translation</strong> - A translation that focuses on reproducing the form of the source text in the target text, even if the meaning changes as a result.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning-based Translation (or Dynamic Translation)</strong> - A translation that focuses on reproducing the meaning of the source text in the target text, even if the form changes as a result.</p>
<p><strong>Passage</strong> - A section of the Bible text that is being talked about. This can be as small as one verse, but it is usually several verses that together have one topic or tell one story.</p>

<h1 id="translate_whatis">What is Translation</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is Translation?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_manual">Introduction to Translation Manual</a><br></p>
<p>Translation is a process performed between different languages that involves a person (the translator) changing a text from one language (the source language) into a different language (the target language).</p>
<p>There are basically two kinds of translations: literal and dynamic (or meaning-based).</p>
<ul>
<li>Literal translations focus on representing words in the source language with words in the target language that have similar basic meanings. They also use phrases that have similar structures to the phrases in the source language. This kind of translation allows the reader to see the structure of the source text, but it often makes it difficult or impossible for the reader to understand the meaning of the source text.<br />
</li>
<li>Dynamic, meaning-based translations focus on representing the meaning of the source language sentence in its context, and will use whatever words and phrase structures are most appropriate to convey that meaning in the target language. The goal of this kind of translation is to make it easy for the reader to understand the meaning of the source text. This is the kind of translation recommended in this Translation Manual.</li>

<h1 id="translate_why">Why We Translate the Bible</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: Why should we translate the Bible?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_manual">Introduction to Translation Manual</a><br></p>
<p>The Bible is the most influential book in history. It is God's message to mankind. Jesus commanded the Church to make disciples by teaching people from every nation to observe everything that is contained in it.</p>
<p><em>So go, and using my authority, teach my message to people of all ethnic groups so that they may become my disciples. Baptize them to be under the authority of my Father, and of me, his Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Teach them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember that I will be with you always, until the end of this age.</em> [Matt. 28:19-20, UDB]</p>
<p>The original Bible was written in ancient forms of the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek languages. Few people today understand any of those languages. Therefore, the Bible must be translated so they can read and understand it. People continue to translate the Bible into the languages of every people group so that God's message can change their lives.</p>

<h1 id="translate_process">The Translation Process</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What are two things I do to translate?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_manual">Introduction to Translation Manual</a><br></p>
<p>There are two things to do in translation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discover the meaning in the source language text (See: <a href="#translate_discover">Discover the Meaning of the Text</a>)<br></li>
<li>Re-tell the meaning in the target language translation (See: <a href="#translate_retell">Re-telling the Meaning</a>)<br> Instructions for translation sometimes divide these two things into smaller steps. The graphic below shows how these two fit into the translation process. <img src="https://door43.org/_media/en/ta/translation_process.png" alt="Image" /></li>

<h1 id="translate_discover">Discover the Meaning of the Text</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How Do I Discover the Meaning of the Text?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_process">The Translation Process</a><br></p>
<p>There are many different things that we can do to help us to discover the meaning of the text, that is, to make sure that we understand what the text is trying to say. Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the whole passage through before you translate it. Understand the main point of the whole passage before you begin to translate it. If it is a narrative passage, such as a story of one of Jesus' miracles, picture the original situation. Imagine you were there. Imagine how people felt.</li>
<li><p>When translating the Bible, always use at least two versions of the Bible together as your source text. Comparing two versions will help you to think about the meaning, so that you do not just follow the words of one version literally. The two versions should be:</p>
*One version that follows the form of the original language fairly closely, such as the Unlocked Literal Bible (ULB).
<ul>
<li>One meaning-based version, such as the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use the Important Terms resources to learn about terms that you are not familiar with. Words sometimes have more than one meaning. Make sure that you have understood the right meaning of the word in the passage.</li>
<li><p>Also use the translationNotes that are with the ULB Bible. These are available in the translationStudio program and the Door43 website. These will explain things about the passage that may not be clear. If possible, also use other reference books, such as other versions of the Bible, a Bible dictionary, or Bible commentaries.</p></li>

<h1 id="translate_original">The Original and Source Languages</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is the difference between the original language and the source language?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_process">The Translation Process</a><br></p>
<h3>Original Language is the most Accurate</h3>
<p>The original language is the language in which a Bible text was initially written. The original language of the New Testament is Greek. The original language of most of the Old Testament is Hebrew. However, the original language of some parts of the books of Daniel and Ezra is Aramaic. The original language is always the most accurate language from which to translate a passage.</p>
<p>The source Language is the language from which the translation is being made. If a translator is translating the Bible from the original languages, then the original language and the source language for his translation are the same. However, only people who have spent many years studying the original languages understand them and can use them as a source language. For that reason, most translators use Bibles that have been translated into a language of wider communication as their source language text.</p>
<p>If you are translating from a language of wider communication, it is a good idea to have someone who has studied the original languages compare the meaning in the target language translation with the meaning in the original language to make sure that the meaning is the same. Another way to make sure that the meaning of the target language translation is accurate is to check the translation with translation helps that have been written by people who know the original languages. These would include Bible commentaries and dictionaries, as well as the unfoldingWord Translation Notes, Important Terms definitions, and Translation Questions with their answers.</p>
<h3>Source Language may not be Accurate</h3>
<p>If the translator does not understand the original language, he will have to use a language of wider communication as a source language. The meaning in the source may be correct, depending on how carefully it was translated from the original. But it is still a translation, so it is a step away from the original and is not quite the same. In some cases, the source may have actually been translated from another source, rather than from the original, putting it two steps away from the original.</p>
<p>Consider the example below. A translator uses a Swahili New Testament as the source for a new target language translation. However, the particular Swahili Bible version he is using was actually translated from English — not directly from the Greek (the original language). So it is possible that some of the meaning has changed in the chain of translation from the original to the target languages. <img src="https://door43.org/_media/en/ta/ol2sl2sl2tl_small_600-174.png" alt="Image" /></p>
<p>The only way to make sure the translation is as accurate as possible is to compare the new translation with the original languages. Where this is not possible, use the ULB and UDB as source texts, along with other Bible translations that were translated from the original languages.</p>

<h1 id="translate_retell">Re-telling the Meaning</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How do I re-tell the meaning?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_process">The Translation Process</a><br></p>
<p>Following is a list of ordered steps. The purpose of these steps is to help the translator produce a translation that is natural, understandable, and accurate. One of the most common translator mistakes is failing to use the natural forms in the target language for developing a coherent text. By following these steps, the translator will produce a more natural and more understandable translation.</p>
<p>-Read the entire chosen passage in the source language. The passage should be a portion or whole section (in the Bible from one title to the next title.) -Without looking at the text in the source language, verbally tell it in the target language. Although you might forget some parts, continue telling what you remember right to the end. -Again, look at the source language text. Now tell everything again in the target language. -Looking again at the source language text, focus only on the parts you forgot, and then say it all in the target language by memory. -After remembering the entire passage, write it exactly as it you said it by memory. -Once written, look at the source language to see if you have overlooked some detail. Insert any such detail. -If you do not understand something in the source text, write into the translation ‘[not understood]’ and continue writing the rest of the passage. -Now, read what you wrote. Assess whether you understand it or not. Fix the parts that should be improved. -Go on to the next section. Read it in the source language. Strictly follow steps 2 through 8.</p>

<h1 id="translate_manuscripts">Original Manuscripts</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: Is there more information about the Original Language text?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_retell">Re-telling the Meaning</a><br></p>
<p>The Bible was written many hundreds of years ago as God inspired his prophets and apostles in ancient times. The Old Testament books were written in Hebrew, with a few parts in Aramaic, the language that the people of Israel used as they lived in exile in Assyria and Babylon. The New Testament books were written in Greek, the language that was used for wider communication throughout the known world between 300 years before Christ and 300 years after Christ. The Old Testament was also translated into Greek about two to three hundred years before Christ.</p>
<p>Since there was no paper in those early days, these writings were put on specially prepared animal skins or a material woven of reeds. These writings were extremely important, so trained people copied them over and over by hand, with great care to be accurate and faithful to the original text that they were copying.</p>
<p>Over hundreds of years, people made very many copies of the Bible and these copies became spread throughout the ancient world. As the Bible was translated into other ancient languages such as Latin, the translators in various parts of the world used the copies that were available to them when they translated. Later, people began to collect these copies and compare them. While these copies were very much the same, some of them had small differences from each other.</p>
<p>To decide which copies were right at these places where there were small differences, Bible scholars decided that the oldest copies were better because they were closer to the originals. Where the more recent copies were different, the Bible scholars decided that these differences were either accidental errors made while copying or sometimes they were ideas put into the copies by people who were not copying in a strictly faithful manner. So, when we try to decide which copies are more reliable or trustworthy, we prefer the older ones and also we prefer the groups of copies that were made by people who followed a tradition that had a reputation for accuracy and faithfulness.</p>

<h1 id="translate_textvariants">Textual Variants</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: Why does the ULB have missing or added verses</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_manuscripts">Original Manuscripts</a><br></p>
<p>Some people who were making copies of Bible books added words or even whole sentences into the text that they copied. Sometimes this was to explain what was in the text and sometimes it was to add to the ideas in the text, often using phrases from other places in the Bible. Sometimes this happened accidentally, as the person copied something twice or included in the text a comment that someone else had written beside the text. Sometimes words were left out by accident, as well. But over all, the Bible books have been copied with great accuracy and faithfulness over many, many years. By comparing many different copies with each other, Bible scholars can decide which copies are accurate and which ones have errors.</p>
<p>Sometimes there will be a footnote with the ULB that says something like, “some ancient authorities add a verse here.” We recommend that the translator include this footnote when translating the passages where it appears in the ULB. For example, there will be a note like this at Mark 16:9-20 and at verses such as Acts 8:37 and 1 John 5:7-8. This means that some copies of the Bible have these verses, but others that are older and considered to be accurate do not.</p>
<p>The Bible student needs to be careful to look at the history of the added words and what Bible scholars say about them in order to determine whether they are likely to be from the original text. This requires a great deal of study and many resources that we cannot provide through Door43.org. We recommend that the Bible translator follow these guidelines when translating such passages:</p>
<h3>Translation Suggestions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Translators have a choice about which manuscripts to follow. They can translate as the ULB does, or if they prefer other Bibles that follow other manuscripts, they may follow them.</li>
<li>If translators follow the ULB, translating the verses that are there and not translating verses that are not in the ULB, they should also translate the footnotes that the ULB provides in those places.</li>
<li>If translators follow other manuscripts (for example, if they translate Acts 8:37 as part of their main text although the ULB does not include that verse), they may need to write their footnote differently, for example, “Some ancient authorities omit verse 37.”</li>
</ul>


<h1 id="translate_fandm">Form and Meaning</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is form and meaning?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#translate_terms">Terms to Know</a><br></li>
<li><a href="#translate_process">The Translation Process</a><br></li>
</ul>
<p>Two of the major terms used in translating text are &quot;form&quot; and &quot;meaning.&quot; These terms are used in special ways in Bible translation. They have the following definitions:</p>
<p><strong>Form</strong> - The structure of the language as it appears on the page or as it is spoken. &quot;Form&quot; refers to the way that the language is arranged - it includes the words, the word order, the grammar, idioms, and any other features of the structure of the text.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong> - The underlying idea or concept that the text is trying to communicate to the reader or hearer. A speaker or writer can communicate the same meaning by using different forms of the language, and different people can understand different meanings from hearing or reading the same language form. In this way you can see that form and meaning are not the same thing. Let's consider an example from normal life. Suppose a friend sent you the note below:</p>
<p><em>&quot;I am having a very difficult week. My mother was sick and I spent all of my money to take her to the doctor and to buy medicine for her. I don't have anything left. My employer will not pay me until next weekend. I don't know how I am going to make it through the week. I don't even have money to buy food.&quot;</em></p>
<h3>The Meaning</h3>
<p>Why do you think the friend sent this note? Just to tell you about his week? Probably not. His true intention was more likely to tell you:</p>
<p><em>&quot;I need you to give me money.&quot;</em></p>
<p>That is the primary <strong>meaning</strong> of the note that the sender wanted to communicate to you. However, it would be rude in some cultures to ask for money so directly—even from a friend. Therefore, he adjusted the <strong>form</strong> of the note to fill out the request and help you to understand his need. He wrote in a culturally-acceptable way that presented his need for money but did not obligate you to respond. He explained why he had no money (his sick mother), that his need was only temporary (until he is paid), and that his situation was desperate (no food). In other cultures, a more direct form of request might be more appropriate to communicate this meaning.</p>
<h3>The Form</h3>
<p>In this example, the <strong>form</strong> is the entire text of the note. The <strong>meaning</strong> is &quot;I need you to give me money!&quot;</p>
<p>We use these terms in a similar way. <strong>Form</strong> will refer to the entire text of the verses that we are translating. <strong>Meaning</strong> will refer to the idea or ideas that the text is trying to communicate. The best form for communicating a certain meaning will be different in different languages and cultures.</p>

<h1 id="translate_form">The Importance of Form</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is the importance of form?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#translate_fandm">Form and Meaning</a><br></li>
<li><a href="#translate_process">The Translation Process</a><br></li>
</ul>
<p>The meaning of a text is the most crucial element. However, the form of the text is also very important. It is more than just a &quot;container&quot; for the meaning. It affects the way the meaning is understood and received. So the form itself also has a meaning. For example, look at the differences in form between these translations of Psalm 9:1-2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will give thanks to the Lord with all my heart. I will tell of all the great things You have done. I will be glad and full of joy because of You. I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.<br> (New Life Version)<br></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart;<br> I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.<br> I will be glad and exult in you;<br> I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.<br> (New Revised Standard Version)<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first version puts the text into a form that is no different than the form it uses for telling stories. Each line of the Psalm is stated as a separate sentence. In the second version, the text is arranged as lines of poetry are arranged in the target culture, with each line of the poem on a separate line of the page. Also, the first two lines are joined with a semi-colon, with the second line indented. These things indicate that they are related - they say very similar things. The third and fourth lines also have the same arrangement. A reader of the second version will know that this Psalm is a poem or a song because of the form that it has, while the reader of the first version may not get that understanding, because it was not communicated through the form of the text. The reader of the first version might be confused, because the Psalm seems to be a song, but it is not presented as one. The words are expressing a joyful emotion. As a translator, you should use the form for expressing a joyful song in your language.</p>
<p>Look also at the form of 2 Samuel 18:33b:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you--O Absalom, my son, my son!&quot; <br> (New International Version)<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone might say that the meaning contained in this part of the verse is, &quot;I wish that I had died instead of my son Absalom.&quot; This does summarize the meaning contained in the words. But the form communicates much more than just that content. The repetition of &quot;my son&quot; so many times, the repetition of the name &quot;Absalom,&quot; the expression &quot;O,&quot; the wish form &quot;If only...&quot; all communicate a strong emotion of deep anguish on the part of a father who has lost a son. As a translator, you need to translate not just the meaning of the words, but also the meaning of the form. For 2 Samuel 18:33b, it is important that you use a form that communicates the same emotion as contained in the original language.</p>
<p>So we need to examine the form of the biblical text and ask ourselves why it has that form and not some other one. What attitude or emotion is it communicating? Other questions that might help us to understand the meaning of the form are: Who wrote it? Who received it? In what situation was it written? Which words and phrases were chosen and why? Are the words very emotional words, or is there anything special about the order of the words? When we understand the meaning of the form, then we can choose a form that has that same meaning in the target language and culture.</p>
<h3>Culture Affects Meaning</h3>
<p>The meaning of forms is determined by culture. The same form might have different meanings in different cultures. In translation, the meaning must remain the same, including the meaning of the form. This means that the form of the text must change to fit the culture. The form includes the language of the text, its arrangement, any repetitions, or any expressions that imitate sounds like &quot;O.&quot; You must examine all of these things, decide what they mean, and then decide which form will express that meaning in the best way for the target language and culture.</p>

<h1 id="translate_levels">Levels of Meaning</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What are the Levels of Meaning?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_fandm">Form and Meaning</a><br></p>
<p>A good translation requires that the meaning be the same in the target language as in the source language. There are many different levels of meaning in the Bible. These levels include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meaning of words</li>
<li>Meaning of phrases</li>
<li>Meaning of sentences</li>
<li>Meaning of paragraphs</li>
<li>Meaning of chapters</li>
<li>Meaning of books</li>
</ul>
<h3>Words Have Meaning</h3>
<p>That is, even the smallest unit, a word, has a meaning. But this meaning is determined by the context that the word is in. For example, a single word like &quot;give&quot; may have the following possible meanings, depending on the context:</p>
<ul>
<li>to grant a gift</li>
<li>to collapse or break</li>
<li>to surrender</li>
<li>to quit</li>
<li>to concede</li>
<li>to supply</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Building the Larger Meaning</h3>
<p>The translator must determine what each word means in the context, and then reproduce the same meaning in the translated text. These words then combine into phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc. Therefore, the translator must also make sure that the words fit together into equivalent phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc. so that the translated text has the same meaning on each level.</p>

<p>Literal translations focus on the form of the text.</p>
<h4>Other Names</h4>
<p>Literal translations are also called:</p>
<ul>
<li>form-based</li>
<li>modified literal</li>
<li>word-for-word substitution</li>
</ul>
<h4>Form Over Meaning</h4>
<p>A literal translation is one that focuses on reproducing the form of the source text in the target text, even if the meaning changes, or is hard to understand, as a result. An extreme version of a literal translation would not be a translation at all—it would have the same characters and words as the source language. The next closest step would be to replace each word in the source language with an equivalent word from the target language. Because of differences in grammar between languages, the target language audience would probably not understand this kind of translation. Some translators of the Bible wrongly believe that they should keep the word order of the source text in the target text and only substitute target language words for surce language words. They wrongly believe that this shows respect for the source text as God's word. But in fact this kind of translation keeps people from understanding God's word. God wants people to understand his word, so it shows the greatest respect for the Bible and for God to translate the Bible so people can understand it.</p>
<h4>Weaknesses of Literal Translation</h4>
<p>Literal translations usually contain the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>foreign words that are not understood by the target audience</li>
<li>word order that is strange or awkward in the target language</li>
<li>idioms that are not used or understood in the target language</li>
<li>names of objects that do not exist in the target culture</li>
<li>descriptions of customs that are not understood in the target culture</li>
<li>paragraphs that have no logical connections in the target language</li>
<li>stories and explanations that do not make sense in the target language</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="translate_wforw">Word for Word Substitution</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: Why should I not translate using word for word substitution?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_literal">Literal Translations</a><br></p>
<p>A word-for-word substitution is the most literal form of translation. It is not the best choice for doing good translations. A word-for-word translation simply substitutes an equivalent word in the target language for each word in the source language.</p>
<h3>In word-for-word translations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The focus is on one word at a time.</p></li>
<li>The natural sentence structure, phrase structures and figures of speech of the target language are ignored.</li>
<li>The process of word-for-word translation is very simple.
<ul>
<li>The first word in the source text is translated by an equivalent word.</li>
<li>Then the next word is done. This process continues until the verse is translated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The word-for-word approach is attractive because it is so simple. However, it results in a poor quality translation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Word-for-word substitution results in translations that are awkward to read. They are often confusing and give the wrong meaning or even no meaning at all. You should avoid doing this type of translation.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p><strong> Word Order</strong></p>
<p>Here is an example of Luke 3:16 in the NET Bible. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>John answered them all, “I baptize you with water, but one more powerful than I am is coming. I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. </em><br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That translation is clear and easy to understand. But suppose the translators had used the word-for-word method. What would the translation be like?</p>
<p>Here, translated in English, are the words in the same order as the original Greek.</p>
<p><em>answered saying to all the John I indeed with water baptize you he comes but who mightier than I of whom not I am worthy untie the strap of the sandals of him he you will baptize with spirit holy and fire </em></p>
<p>This translation is awkward and can be hard to understand in English. How does it sound in your language?</p>
<p>Look at the NET version above again. Notice the difference. The English NET translators did not keep the original Greek word order. They moved words around in the sentence to fit the rules of English grammar. They also changed some of the phrasing. For example, the English NET Bible said “John answered them” rather than “John answered to all saying,” They used different words to make the text sound natural in English.</p>
<p>It is important that the final result communicates the same meaning as the Greek text.</p>
<p>In this example the NET is a much better English translation than the awkward word-for-word version.</p>
<p><strong>Range of Word Meanings</strong></p>
<p>In addition, word-for-word substitution does not take into account that most individual words have a range of meanings. In word-for-word translations only one meaning is chosen.</p>
<p>For example, the Greek word aggelos can refer to a human messenger or to an angel.</p>
<p>In Luke 7:27, the word aggelos refers to a human messenger. Jesus was talking about John the Baptist when he said “This is he of whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, Who will prepare your way before you.’</p>
<p>In Luke 2:15, it refers to angels when it says “when the angels went away from them into the sky.”</p>
<p>A word-for-word substitution might translate the Greek word in both verses as “messenger” or “angel” even though it is used to refer to two different kinds of beings. This would be confusing to the reader.</p>
<p><strong>Figures of Speech</strong></p>
<p>Finally, word-for-word substitution does not convey the meaning of a figure of speech.</p>
<p>Figures of Speech have meanings that are different from the individual words that they are made up of. When they are translated word-for-word, their meanings are not clear. Even if they are translated so that they follow the normal word order of they language they are translated into, their meaning may not be clear. Please go to the Figures of Speech module to learn more on how to correctly translate them.</p>

<h1 id="translate_problem">Problems with Literal Translations</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What are several problems with translations that are too literal?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_literal">Literal Translations</a><br></p>
<p><strong>1. The meaning of forms change</strong></p>
<p>Literal translations keep the form of the source text in the target text. Some translators might want to do this because, as we saw in the teaching module &quot;The Importance of Form,&quot; the form of a text affects the meaning of the text. However, we must keep in mind that people from different cultures understand the meaning of forms differently. In different cultures, the same form may be understood in very different ways. Therefore it is not possible to protect the meaning from change by keeping the original forms. The only way to protect the meaning is to change the original form to a new form that communicates the same meaning in the new culture as the old form did in the old culture.</p>
<p><strong>2. Different languages use different orders of words and phrases</strong></p>
<p>If you keep the source word order in your translation, it will be very difficult, and sometimes impossible, for the people who speak your language to understand it. You must use the natural word order of the target language so that people can understand the meaning of the text.</p>
<p><strong>3. Different languages use different idioms and expressions</strong></p>
<p>Each language has its own idioms and other expressions, such as words that represent sounds or emotions. In order to express the meaning of these things, you must choose an idiom or expression that has that same meaning in the target language, not just translate each word. If you do that, the idiom or expression will have the wrong meaning.</p>
<p><strong>4. Some terms do not have equivalents in other cultures</strong></p>
<p>The Bible contains many terms for things that no longer exist, such as ancient weights (stadia, cubit), money (denarius, stater) and measures (hin, ephah). Animals in Scripture may not exist in some parts of the world (fox, camel). Other words may be unknown in some cultures (snow, circumcision). It is not possible to simply substitute equivalent words for these terms in those situations. The translator must find another way to communicate the original meaning.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Bible was intended to be understood</strong></p>
<p>The testimony of the Scriptures themselves shows that they were meant to be understood. The Bible is written in three languages because the language of the people changed. When the Jews returned from exile and no longer remembered Hebrew, the priests translated the Old Testament readings into Aramaic so they could understand (Neh 8:8). Later, when the New Testament was written, it was written in the common Koine Greek, which was the language that most people spoke at that time, rather than Hebrew or Aramaic or even classical Greek, which would have been harder for common people to understand. These and other reasons demonstrate that God wants people to understand his word. So we know that he wants us to translate the meaning of the Bible, not reproduce the form. The meaning of the Scriptures is more important than the form.</p>

<h1 id="translate_dynamic">Meaning-Based Translations</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What are Meaning Based Translations?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#translate_whatis">What is Translation</a><br></li>
<li><a href="#translate_process">The Translation Process</a><br></li>
<li><a href="#translate_literal">Literal Translations</a><br></li>
<li><a href="#translate_fandm">Form and Meaning</a><br></li>
</ul>
<p>We have looked closely at literal translations. Now, we will look at meaning-based translations. Meaning-based translations are also called:</p>
<ul>
<li>meaning-equivalent</li>
<li>idiomatic</li>
<li>dynamic</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Characteristic</h3>
<p>The key characteristic of meaning-based translations is that they give priority to translating the meaning over reproducing the form of the source text. That is, they <strong>change the form of the text as needed in order to make the meaning clear.</strong> The most common types of changes that meaning-based translations make are:</p>
<ul>
<li>change word order to match the grammar of the target language</li>
<li>change order of reasons or results to match the normal order of the flow of logic in the target language</li>
<li>substitute or explain idioms</li>
<li>explain or translate terms from other languages (ex: &quot;Golgotha&quot; = &quot;place of the skull&quot;)</li>
<li>use phrases with simpler words instead of trying to find single word equivalents for difficult or uncommon words in the source text</li>
<li>replace terms that are unknown in the target culture with equivalent terms or descriptions *replace connecting words that the target language does not use with connecting words that the target language needs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples of Meaning-Based Translations</h3>
<p>What does a meaning-based translation look like? We will look at how different versions translate the same verse.</p>
<p>In Luke 3:8, <em>John the Baptist rebukes the self-righteous people who came to be baptized.</em></p>
<p>The <strong>Greek </strong> text of the first half of the verse is shown below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ποιήσατε οὖν καρποὺς ἀξίους τῆς μετανοίας<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>English </strong> translation in the same order as each Greek word, with some alternative English words to choose from, is below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do/make/produce therefore fruits fit/appropriate of the repentance<br></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Literal</h4>
<p>A literal translation would usually follow the words and order of the Greek text as closely as possible, such as the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance, … (NASB)<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that this fairly-literal translation retains the words &quot;fruits&quot; and &quot;repentance.&quot; The word order is also very similar to the Greek text.</p>
<h4>Meaning-Based</h4>
<p>Meaning-based translations, on the other hand, are more likely to change the words and order if the translators think it will help to clarify the meaning. Consider these two meaning-based translations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>…prove that you have turned from sin by doing worthy deeds.</em> (Living Bible (LB))<br></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God. </em> (New Living Translation (NLT))<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that both of these translations have changed the word order to be more natural in English. Also, the word &quot;fruits&quot; no longer appears. In fact, the LB translation does not use any of the words in the NASB translation. Instead, rather than &quot;fruits,&quot; the meaning-based translations refer to &quot;deeds&quot; or to &quot;the way you live.&quot; &quot;Fruits&quot; in this verse is used as part of a metaphor. The meaning of &quot;fruits&quot; in this metaphor is &quot;the things that a person does.&quot; (See the teaching module on Metaphor.) So these translations translated the meaning in context, rather than just the word. They also used more understandable phrases such as, &quot;turned from sin&quot; rather than the single difficult word, &quot;repentance,&quot; or they explained the word by saying, &quot;repented of your sins and turned to God.&quot; The meaning in all of them is the same, but the form is very different. In the meaning-based translations, the meaning is much clearer.</p>
<p>Next we recommend you learn about: <a href="#translate_tform">Translate for Meaning</a><br></p>


<h1 id="translate_tform">Translate for Meaning</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: Why should I translate for meaning?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_dynamic">Meaning-Based Translations</a><br></p>
<p>The people who wrote the Bible had messages from God that God wanted people to understand. These original writers used whatever language that they and their people spoke at the time when God gave his message so that they and their people could understand God's messages. God wants people today to understand those same messages. But people today do not speak those languages that the Bible was written in long ago. So God has given us the task of translating the Bible into the languages that people speak today.</p>
<p>From this we can see that the particular language that people use to communicate God's messages is not important. The particular words that are used is not important. What is important is the meaning that those words communicate. The meaning is the message, not the words or the language. What we must translate, then, is not the words or the forms of the sentences of the source languages, but the meaning.</p>
<p>Look at the pairs of sentences below. - -It rained all night. -Rain fell all night. - -John was very surprised when he heard the news. -The news very much amazed John when he heard it. - -It was a hot day. -The day was hot. - - Peter’s house -The house that belongs to Peter</p>
<p>You can see that the meaning of each pair of sentences is the same, even though they use different words. This is the way it is in a good translation. We will use different words than the source text, but we will keep the meaning the same. We will use words that our people understand and use them in a way that is natural for our language. Communicating the same meaning as the source text in a clear and natural way is the goal of translation.</p>

<h1 id="translate_what">What to Start Translating</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What do I start translating?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_manual">Introduction to Translation Manual</a><br></p>
<h3>What To Start Translating</h3>
<p>We recommend that you begin by translating Open Bible Stories. You can work your way through the Stories in whatever order that you want, but we have found <a href="https://door43.org/en/obs/31">Story #31</a> (https://door43.org/en/obs/31) is a good first story to translate since it is short and easy to understand.<br></p>
<h3>Translate from the Source Language</h3>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Source Language&quot; refers to the language from which the translation is being done.</li>
<li>&quot;Target Language&quot; refers to the language into which the translation is being done.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you find your target language and make sure that it is <a href="https://door43.org/obs-setup">set up</a> (https://door43.org/obs-setup) on Door43, you can then choose the source language from a list of approved source languages. After that has been set up, the page for the target language translation will have the text of Open Bible Stories on it from the source language. The translator can then translate from the source language into the target language on that same page, and then delete the source language when translation is completed. <br></p>

<h1 id="translate_help">Help with Translating</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: Where do I find help for translating?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_what">What to Start Translating</a><br></p>
<p>To help translators make the best translation possible, Translation Notes and Translation Words have been created. There is a set of <a href="https://door43.org/en/obs/notes">Translation Notes</a> (https://door43.org/en/obs/notes) and <a href="https://door43.org/en/obe/kt/home">Translation Words</a> (https://door43.org/en/obe/kt/home) for Open Bible Stories, and also <a href="https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/home">Translation Notes</a> (https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/home) and <a href="https://door43.org/en/obe/home">Translation Words</a> (https://door43.org/en/obe/home) for the Bible.<br></p>
<p>Translation Notes are cultural, linguistic, and exegetical notes that help to describe and explain some of the Bible background that the translator needs to know to translate Open Bible Stories, as well as inform translators about different ways that they might express the same meaning.</p>
<p>The Translation Words are key terms found in Open Bible Stories and the Bible that are important to translate correctly. Each of these important terms has a small article written about it as well as cross-references to other places where that term is used in either Open Bible Stories or the Bible. This is to show the translator other ways that the important term is used and to ensure that it has been translated correctly in those places, too.</p>
<p>Once you have consulted the Translation Notes and Translation Words, then you are ready to make the best translation.</p>
<p><strong>Please use the Translation Notes &amp; Translation Words when doing your translation!</strong></p>

<p>This module answers the question: How do I use the Translation Notes on Door 43?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translate_help">Help with Translating</a><br></p>
<h2>Use the Translation Notes on Door43</h2>
<h4>Open Bible Stories</h4>
<p>For translating Open Bible Stories, it is best to open the webpage of the story in the target language and also the webpage of the story with <a href="https://door43.org/en/obs/notes">Translation Notes</a> (https://door43.org/en/obs/notes). Unless someone has already translated the Translation Notes into the target language, they will be in the source language. To begin with, both webpages will be in the source language.<br></p>
<p>This <a href="http://youtu.be/5fFl8crhglE">video</a> (http://youtu.be/5fFl8crhglE) (1 minute 20 seconds) will give a quick overview of how to use the Translation Notes.<br></p>
<ul>
<li>The stories are separated into separate pages with a part of the story and a picture for that part of the story on each page (called a frame).</li>
<li>The webpage that you opened in the target language has the picture and the text from the story, but it is still in the source language.</li>
<li>You can start translating the story into the target language underneath the source language on that page.</li>
<li>There is a list of the Important Terms from each part of the story below where you are translating. This list is there to help you to translate them correctly. Click on the green word to go to another page that will give more information on how to translate each Important Term.</li>
<li>Below that are the Translation Notes. These Notes explain how to translate some parts of the story that might be difficult. The Note should help you understand how to translate.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Bible</h4>
<p>The process of translating the Bible is very similar to the process of translating Open Bible Stories, so please read the instructions above. Translating Open Bible Stories will give you good practice in how to translate, and how to use these translation tools. We highly recommend that you translate Open Bible stories first, and then start translating the Bible.</p>
<p>When you are ready to start translating the Bible, open the page that has the first chunk of the Bible book that you want to translate and also the Translation Notes for that chunk, in both the target language and the source language, as explained above. The page that has a link to the text and notes for each book of the Bible in English is here: https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/home. Each page will have a chunk of Bible text, usually 2 to 3 verses, then the list of Translation Words (Important Terms), then the Translation Notes for that chunk of Bible text. Each page is very much like a frame from Open Bible Stories, and works the same way.</p>

<h1 id="translate_unknown">Translate Unknowns</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How do I translate words that I do not know?</p>
<p>There are times that the source language will use words and ideas that are not familiar. If you do not know what the source word means, the Translation Notes and Important Terms pages will help you understand its meaning. Sometimes, however, a word in the source text is an object, animal, practice, or other thing that is not known to the people who speak the target language. The following information will help with translating these unknown things or concepts.</p>
<h2>Historical facts</h2>
<p>It is very important to remember that if the term expresses a historical fact, then that fact must be kept in a translation. For example, in Mark 11:13, Jesus cursed a fig tree. To substitute any other kind of tree would be untrue to a historical fact. To translate this, follow one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a general descriptive phrase, such as &quot;a fruit tree.&quot;</li>
<li>Use a descriptive phrase with a borrowed word, such as &quot;a tree that bears fruit called 'figs.'&quot;</li>
<li><p>Use a borrowed word for the name of the tree: &quot;a fig tree.&quot; For the last two choices, a footnote would be necessary to explain what &quot;fig&quot; means. Another example is In John 12:14-15 where it says that Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey's colt, which fulfilled a prophecy in the the Old Testament. Since it says that Jesus was sitting on a donkey's colt, which is a young donkey, the translation should not say that he sat on an ox, for example. If the word for &quot;donkey&quot; does not exist in the target language, a borrowed word could be used and explained in the text or in a footnote. For example, the text could say, “riding on the young of a kind of work animal called a ‘donkey.'” This is different from the use of an animal as part of a teaching or illustration. In that case, it is not a matter of historical fact. See the example of &quot;wolf&quot; below.</p>
<h3>Food and other objects</h3></li>
<li>plow (vs hand planting)
<ul>
<li>See the example of translating '<a href="https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/luk/09/61">plow</a>' in Luke 9:62.<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li>grapes, vineyard</li>
<li>wheat</li>
<li>bread</li>
<li><p>numbers, numerals</p>
<h3>Animals</h3>
<p>An example of the use of an animal in the Bible as an illustration is in John 10:12 where the word &quot;wolf&quot; is used as a way to describe a person who is harmful to God's people. There are many things to describe about a wolf but what is important in this verse is that it is a fierce and dangerous animal that frightens and harms the sheep. If a wolf is an unknown animal in your culture, you could substitute an animal that looks similar and that has similar characteristics. For example, large wild dogs are similar to wolves. They attack and eat other animals, such as lambs. So “wolves” could be translated with a generic term like “wild dogs” or “fierce dogs” or with the name of a specific animal like a dog that your people know of, such as “coyotes” or “jackals.” You could also use a general descriptive phrase such as, &quot;a dangerous wild animal&quot; that focuses on the characteristics that are being highlighted in the text. Also see the Translation Note at Luke 10:3 for other translation suggestions for <a href="https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/luk/10/03">&quot;wolf.&quot;</a><br></p>
<h3>Cultural practices</h3>
<p>There might be many differences between the biblical culture and the target language culture. Sometimes a cultural substitute can be used. But be careful not to change any historical facts (see explanation above). The unknown biblical practice could be explained in a footnote or Bible teaching. The explanations could include a known cultural practice that has the same meaning as the one described in the Bible text. For example, in Jewish culture, grief and repentance for sin were shown by wearing a rough type of cloth (sackcloth) and putting ashes on the head. Wailing was another sign of grief. In other cultures grief may be shown in different ways. But if this practice was something that actually happened it needs to be recorded as such, with an explanation that tells what it means, perhaps using a practice from the target culture that has the same meaning. For example, in certain cultures when men greeted other men who were family or friends, they would kiss them on one cheek or both cheeks. This can be translated as “to greet him with a kiss” or “to greet him by kissing him.” If this is not done in your culture, you could explain it with a footnote. If your readers would find it embarrassing or inappropriate to say that a man would kiss another man, you could translate it in a more general way such as, “to give him a friendly greeting.” See the example of <a href="https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/luk/22/47">'greet with a kiss'</a> in Luke 22:47.<br></p>
<h2>Translation Suggestions</h2>
<p>Here are suggestions to keep in mind when translating a term that is not familiar in your language:</p></li>
<li>Use a descriptive phrase. You will most likely need to use a phrase to explain the meaning of the unknown word. It is important only to describe the part of the meaning which is being used in the particular verse being translated.</li>
<li>Substitute something similar. At times the exact word may be unknown to the people of the target language but there might be something similar that could be used in its place. Only do this if the term does not express a historical fact.</li>
<li>Use a foreign word from another language. Foreign words are words taken from a language that is not the target language. You could also use the foreign word together with a general word or descriptive phrase.</li>
<li>Use a word that is more general in meaning. An example would be &quot;work animal&quot; which is more general than the word &quot;donkey.&quot; This is acceptable because a donkey is a kind of work animal.</li>
<li><p>Use a word or phrase that is more specific in meaning. Sometimes there is no general word in the target language to describe the term, therefore you can give specific examples of the term being referred to. An example would be if there is no word for &quot;lights&quot; to refer to heavenly bodies, you could possibly say, &quot;the sun, the moon, and the stars,&quot; using specific words.</p></li>

<h3>Identify Something with a Proper Name:</h3>
<p>A Proper Name (or Proper Noun) is a specific name for someone or something. In contrast, the word &quot;mountain&quot; is a common name–it is a general term describing a kind of landform. Mount Zion is a specific mountain in Israel; therefore, it is a Proper Name. Understanding this difference will help you as you watch the video (see link below). Within the Bible you will hear many proper names which might be unknown to the reader. It could be unclear what the name is referring to. A Proper Name could refer to a person, a country, a certain landform, a body of water, or something else. In this video you will learn how to identify what kind of thing a particular proper name is referring to.</p>

<h2>Translation Suggestions</h2>
<p>There are many things to keep in mind when translating a name in the Bible:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Proper names sometimes reveal information about the person, place, or thing it refers to.</p></li>
<li>Proper names of people may reveal something about the origin or history of the family.</li>
<li>Proper names of people may reveal something about a characteristic of the person.</li>
<li><p>Sometimes people and places have more than one name.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are the different ways to translate names in the Bible. Discuss these with the translation team, and choose one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy the proper name from the source language into the target language with no change. Often, this means using the name as it is spelled in the national language translation.</li>
<li>Use the name from the source language, but make adjustments to the spelling or add whatever is necessary so that it sounds like the right kind of name in the target language.</li>
<li>Pronounce the name as it is pronounced in the source language, and using the target language's spelling system, write the name in a way that people will read it with the source language's pronunciation.</li>
<li><p>Translate the meaning of the name. If a person or place has two names, follow one of these two ways. In either case, it may be necessary to add a footnote that explains that the two names refer to the same person or place:</p></li>
<li>Use the name that occurs in the particular text you are translating.</li>
<li><p>Use one name most of the time and the other name only when the text talks about that name or the meaning of that name.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples from the Bible</h2>
<p><strong>Luke 1:3</strong> “Having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I also have decided to write a careful account for you, most honorable Theophilus.”</p>
<p><em>The word &quot;honorable&quot; describes a person. So &quot;honorable&quot; tells us that Theophilus is the name of a person.</em></p>
<p><strong>Psalms 72:2</strong> &quot;Jerusalem is where he lives; Mount Zion is his home.&quot;</p>
<p><em>The word &quot;Mount&quot; next to &quot;Zion&quot; lets us know that it refers to a mountain landform named &quot;Zion&quot; or &quot;Mount Zion.&quot; &quot;Jerusalem&quot; is the name of a city. We know it is a place because it is where someone lives, and this verse also tells us that Jerusalem is located on Mount Zion.</em></p>
<p><strong>John 21:1</strong> “Later, Jesus appeared again to the disciples beside the Sea of Galilee.”</p>
<p><em>The text refers to a place called the Sea of Galilee. &quot;Sea&quot; is our clue that the Sea of Galilee is a body of water.</em></p>


<h1 id="guidelines_intro">The Qualities of a Good Translation</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What are the qualities of a good translation?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</a><br></p>
<h3>Four Main Qualities</h3>
<p>There are four main qualities of a good translation. It must be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clear</p></li>
<li>Accurate</li>
<li>Natural</li>
<li><p>Equal</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can think of each of these qualities as a leg of a four-legged stool. Each one is necessary. If one is missing, the stool will not stand. Likewise, each of these qualities must be present in a translation in order for it to be useful and faithful to God's intent.</p>
<h3>Accurate</h3>
<p>Translate accurately, without detracting from, changing, or adding to the meaning of the original text. Translated content should faithfully communicate as precisely as possible the meaning of the original text as it would have been understood by the original audience. Translate with the meaning of the text in mind and communicate accurately the implicit information, unknown concepts and figures of speech.</p>
<h3>Clear</h3>
<p>Use whatever language structures are necessary to achieve the highest level of comprehension. This includes simplifying concepts, rearranging the form of a text, and using as many or as few terms as necessary to communicate the original meaning as accurately as possible.</p>
<h3>Natural</h3>
<p>Use language forms that are effective and that reflect the way your language is used in corresponding contexts.</p>
<h3>Equal</h3>
<p>Communicate the same intent as the source text. As much as possible, maintain the literary forms in the original text, including narrative, poetry, exhortation, and prophecy, representing them with corresponding forms that communicate in a similar way in your language.</p>

<h1 id="guidelines_accurate">Create Accurate Translations</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How do I create accurate translations?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#guidelines_intro">The Qualities of a Good Translation</a><br></li>
<li><a href="#translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</a><br></li>
</ul>
<p>To create an ACCURATE translation of the Bible means to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discover the meaning of a passage.</li>
<li>Identify the main idea.</li>
<li>Translate with the author’s message in mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some steps to follow:</p>
<h4>Discover the Meaning</h4>
<p>First, read each passage a few times to <strong>discover the meaning</strong>. Use the two versions of the Bible available in translation Studio: the Unlocked Dynamic Bible and the Unlocked Literal Bible.Also read the definitions of Important Terms and the Translation Notes.</p>
<p>Luke 10:8 and 9 in the Unlocked Dynamic Bible say: “Whenever you enter a town and the people there welcome you, eat whatever food they provide for you. Heal the people there who are sick. Tell them, 'The kingdom of God is right here near you.‘”</p>
<p>Those same verse in the Unlocked Literal Bible say: “Whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat what is set before you, and heal the sick that are there. Say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.‘”</p>
<p>Do you notice the differences? There are some differences in the words each Bible version uses.</p>
<p>Did you discover the meaning is the same? In both versions Jesus is giving specific instructions.</p>
<h4>Identify the Main Idea</h4>
<p>Then, after discovering the meaning of the passage, you should <strong>identify the main idea</strong>.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, “Why is the author writing this, and how does he feel about these things?</p>
<p>Look at the Luke 10 passage again. Why do you think the author is writing this? What do you think the author feels about what he wrote? What do you think? After you have read the passage several times, answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is happening? <em>Jesus gave instructions.</em></li>
<li>When and where did these things take place? <em>To answer this question, you would need to remember what happened earlier. Earlier Luke writes that Jesus and the disciples are on the way to Jerusalem and chapter 10 starts with Jesus sending out 72 people to preach.</em></li>
<li>Who is involved in this passage? <em>Jesus and the 72 people he sent out.</em></li>
<li>Why were the 72 sent out? <em>To heal the sick and to tell everyone that the kingdom of God is near.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>The Message of the Writer</h4>
<p>Finally, part of translating the source text accurately is to think of the original audience and the <strong>message of the writer</strong>.</p>
<p>Do you think the author had specific things for the reader to know? Remember what we thought the author’s main ideas were? The main ideas were:</p>
<ul>
<li>The instructions that Jesus gave</li>
<li>That the 72 people whom Jesus sent out would have power to heal sick people</li>
<li>That they would tell others that the kingdom of God was near</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the message to the original audience. Allow the same message to come clearly into your mind in the target language.</p>
<p>Look at the passage and think how you would retell it in your own language. Keep this initial translation by writing it down. Use an alphabet that suits your language.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Translation is re-telling, as exactly as possible, the meaning of the original message in a way that is clear and natural in the target language.</p>

<h1 id="guidelines_clear">Create Clear Translations</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How do I create clear translations?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#guidelines_intro">The Qualities of a Good Translation</a><br></li>
<li><a href="#translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</a><br></li>
</ul>
<p>To create a clear translation from the source text into your language:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the pronouns in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.</li>
<li>Understand who is doing the action. A clear translation will identify the subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it.</li>
<li>You may need to change each EVENT idea into an active clause if it is in some other form, such as an abstract noun.</li>
<li>You may need to change passive verbs to the active form.</li>
<li>Look at each “of” phrase to identify the meaning of the relationship between the nouns connected by &quot;of.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Check Pronouns</h4>
<p>You will need to <strong>check the pronouns</strong> in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers. Pronouns are words that stand in the place of a noun or a noun phrase. They refer back to something that has already been mentioned.</p>
<p>Always check carefully that it is clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.</p>
<h4>Identify Participants</h4>
<p>Next you need to <strong>understand who is doing the action.</strong> A clear translation will <strong>identify the PARTICIPANTS</strong>. The PARTICIPANTS in an event are the people or things that take part in that event. The subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it are the main PARTICIPANTS. When re-expressing an EVENT idea as a verb, it is often necessary to state who or what are the PARTICIPANTS in that event. Usually this will be clear from the context.</p>
<h4>Change Event Ideas</h4>
<p>A clear translation may need to <strong>express EVENT ideas as verbs</strong>. You may need to <strong>change each EVENT idea into an active clause</strong> to be sure it is understood.</p>
<p>When preparing to translate, it is helpful to look for any EVENT ideas in the passage, especially those which are expressed by some form other than a verb. See if you can re-express the meaning using a verb to express the EVENT idea. If, however, your language also uses nouns to express EVENT ideas and the event or action sounds more natural as a noun, then use the noun form.</p>
<h4>Passive Verbs</h4>
<p>A clear translation may need to change <strong>any PASSIVE verbs to the ACTIVE form</strong>. In the ACTIVE form, the subject of the sentence is the person who does the action. In the PASSIVE form, the subject of the sentence is the person or thing to which the action is done. For example, &quot;John hit Bill&quot; is an active sentence. &quot;Bill was hit by John&quot; is a passive sentence. Many languages do not have a PASSIVE form, only the ACTIVE form exists. Therefore, it may be necessary to turn a sentence from the PASSIVE form into the ACTIVE form.</p>
<h4>Look at Each 'Of' Phrase</h4>
<p>To make a clear translation, you will also need to <strong>look at each “of” phrase to identify the meaning of the relationship between the nouns connected by &quot;of.&quot;</strong> In many languages, “of” constructions are not as frequent as they are in Greek, the original language of the New Testament books. Study the meaning of each one and re-express the meaning of the phrase in a way which makes the relationship between the parts clear.</p>
<p>Translation is re-telling, as exactly as possible, the meaning of the original message in a way that is clear and natural in the target language.</p>

<h1 id="guidelines_natural">Create Natural Translations</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How do I create natural translations?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#guidelines_intro">The Qualities of a Good Translation</a><br></li>
<li><a href="#translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</a><br></li>
</ul>
<p>To translate the Bible so that it is NATURAL means that:</p>
<p>The translation should sound like it was written by a member of the target group—not by a foreigner.</p>
<p>In order for a translation to sound natural, sometimes it is necessary to create shorter, simpler sentences from longer, complex ones. The Greek language often has long, grammatically complicated sentences. Some Bible translations follow the Greek structure closely and keep these long sentences in their translation, even when this does not sound natural or is confusing in the target language.</p>
<p>When preparing to translate, it is often helpful to rewrite the passage, breaking long sentences up into shorter sentences. This can help you to see the meaning more clearly and translate it better. In many languages, it is good style to have shorter sentences, or, when sentences are longer, to avoid having complicated sentences. So in re-expressing the meaning in the Target Language, it is sometimes necessary to break up some of the original long sentences into several shorter sentences. Because many languages use sentences with only one or two clause groupings, the shorter sentences will give a sense of naturalness. The shorter sentences will also give readers a better understanding, because the meaning will be clearer. Be sure to include clear connection words between the new, shorter clauses and sentences.</p>
<p>To make shorter sentences from longer, more complex sentences, identify the words in the sentence that relate directly to each other, that is, that point to one another to form a clause. Generally, each verb or action word has words on either side of it that point back to or forward to the action of the verb. A grouping of words like this that can stand on its own may be written as an independent clause or a simple sentence. Keep each of those groups of words together and in that way divide the sentence into its separate ideas or parts. Then test your translation by reading it to a member of the language community to see if it sounds natural.</p>
<p>A good translation will use the same vocabulary and expressions as the people of the target group normally use. It should be easy for them to read it or listen to it. There should not be any awkward or strange phrases. The translation should read as easily as a letter from a close friend.</p>
<p>Use language forms that are effective and that reflect the way your language is used in corresponding contexts.</p>
<p>Also ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you effectively used punctuation to help a reader know when to pause or to breathe?<br />
</li>
<li>Have you indicated which parts are direct speech?<br />
</li>
<li>Are you separating paragraphs?</li>
<li>Have you followed the verse numbering of your source text and included it in your translation?</li>
</ul>
<p>These points are important in keeping a translation natural.</p>

<li><a href="#guidelines_clear">Create Clear Translations</a><br></li>
<li><a href="#guidelines_equal">Equal Translations</a><br></li>
<li><a href="#translate_discover">Discover the Meaning of the Text</a><br></li>
</ul>


<h1 id="guidelines_equal">Equal Translations</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is an equal translations?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#guidelines_intro">The Qualities of a Good Translation</a><br></li>
<li><a href="#translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</a><br></li>
</ul>
<p>When translating the Bible:</p>
<p>Ensure that any EXPRESSIVE meaning comes across similarly in the target language as it does in the source language. Especially notice the forms in the source text that communicate certain kinds of emotions, and choose forms in the target language that communicate the same emotions. Examples of some of these forms follow.</p>
<h4>Idiom</h4>
<p>Determine the meaning of difficult idioms, proverbs and figures of speech and translate them with meaningful expressions in your language. Usually idioms cannot be translated literally into another language. The meaning of the idiom has to be expressed in a way that is natural in the other language.</p>
<p>Here are three translations, all with the same meaning, of Acts 18:6:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Your blood be upon your heads! I am innocent . . . ” (RSV)</li>
<li>“If you are lost, you yourselves must take the blame for it! I am not responsible . . . ” (GNB)</li>
<li>“If God punishes you, it is because of you, not me!” (TFT)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all accusations of guilt. Some are using idioms with the word “blood” or “lost,” while the third is more direct using the word &quot;punishes.&quot; In order for your translation to be equal, it must also express an accusation, and may use an idiom, as long as both the form of the accusation and the idiom are appropriate for the target language and culture.</p>
<h4>Figure of Speech</h4>
<p>A figure of speech is a special way of saying something in order to catch the attention or express an emotion about what is said. Often the meaning of a figure of speech is different from the literal meaning of the words. The meaning is not intended to be taken literally.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>I was shattered!</strong> The speaker was not literally broken into pieces, but he felt very bad.</p>
<p><strong>He closed his ears to what I was saying.</strong> Meaning, “he chose to not listen to what I was saying.”</p>
<p><strong>The wind moaned in the trees.</strong> This means that the wind blowing through the trees sounded like a person moaning.</p>
<p><strong>The whole world came to the meeting.</strong> Everyone in the world did not attend the meeting. Most likely there were many people at the meeting.</p>
<p>Each language has different kinds of figures of speech. The important thing is that you can:</p>
<p>(1) recognize that a figure of speech is being used,</p>
<p>(2) recognize its purpose, and</p>
<p>(3) know the real meaning.</p>
<p>It is the <strong><strong>real meaning</strong></strong> that should be translated into your language, not the meaning of the individual words.</p>
<p>Some of the purposes for which figures of speech may be used:</p>
<p>(1) For emphasis;</p>
<p>(2) To indicate the attitude of the speaker;</p>
<p>(3) To catch the attention of the hearer;</p>
<p>(4) To produce an emotional response in the hearer; for example: surprise, disapproval, sympathy.</p>
<p>(5) For stylistic variation.</p>
<p>For more information be sure to review the <strong><a href="#figs_intro">Figures of Speech</a></strong> lessons as well. <br></p>
<h4>Rhetorical Questions</h4>
<p><strong><a href="#figs_rquestion">Rhetorical questions</a></strong> are another way that the speaker captures the attention of the reader. Rhetorical questions are a type of questions that do not expect an answer or ask for information. They can be intended as a rebuke, a warning, or to express surprise. <br></p>
<p>All languages use questions. But questions are used for different purposes. The most usual purpose for which a question is used is to ask for information. The person asking the question expects an answer:</p>
<p>Look at Mark chapter 6 verse 38. “And he said to them, ‘How many loaves have you?’” Answer: “Five, and two fish.”</p>
<p>This is an example of a REAL question, a question that expects an answer (although it may not necessarily receive one.) But sometimes questions are used for other purposes:</p>
<p>Such as Mark chapter 8 verse 36. “For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?”</p>
<p>Here no answer is expected. The speaker is not asking for information, he is emphasizing a point: it is no advantage at all to a man to gain possession of the whole world, if by doing so he loses his life. This is an example of a RHETORICAL question. A RHETORICAL question does not ask for information. It has some other purpose.</p>
<p>You may need to restate a rhetorical question as a statement when you translate. Remember, be sure to keep the same purpose and meaning as the original rhetorical question had.</p>
<p><strong>REMEMBER:</strong></p>
<p>Communicate the feelings and attitudes of the original text. Translate them into forms that communicate in a similar way in your language. Consider how that meaning can best be ACCURATELY, CLEARLY, EQUALLY, AND NATURALLY EXPRESSED in the Target Language.</p>

<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#resources_intro">Introduction to Resources</a><br></p>
<h2>Repeated Phrases in a Book</h2>
<p>Sometimes a phrase is used multiple times in one book. When this happens, there will be a link in the Notes - green chapter and verse numbers that you can click on - that will take you back to where you have translated that phrase before. This will make it easier for you to translate this phrase by reminding you of where you have already translated it. This will make your translation faster and more consistent because you will be reminded to translate that phrase in the same way each time. If a translation that you have used before for the same phrase does not fit a new context, then you will have to think of a new way to translate it. In this case, you should make a note of it and discuss it with others on the translation team. These links will only take you back to notes in the book that you are working on.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p><strong>be fruitful and multiply</strong> - See how you translated these commands in <a href="https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/gen/01/28">1:28</a>.<br></p>
<p><strong>everything that creeps along the ground</strong> - This includes all types of small animals. See how you translated this in <a href="https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/gen/01/24">1:25</a>.<br></p>

<h1 id="figs_intro">Figures of Speech</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What are some figures of speech?</p>
<p>Figures of speech are ways of saying things that use words in non-literal ways. That is, the meaning of the figure of speech is not the same as the more direct meaning of the words. In order to translate the meaning, you need to be able to recognize figures of speech and know what the figure of speech means in the source language. Then you can choose either a figure of speech or a direct way to communicate that same meaning in the target language. Listed below are different types of Figures of Speech. If you would like additional information simply click the green word to be directed to a page containing definitions, examples and videos.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#figs_apostrophe">en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe</a></strong> - In apostrophe, a speaker turns his attention from the people he is speaking to and makes an exclamation to someone who is not there with them.<br></p>
<p><strong><a href="#figs_doublet">en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet</a></strong> - A doublet states the same thought in two ways. In the Bible, doublets are often used in poetry, prophecy, and sermons.<br></p>
<p><strong><a href="#figs_euphemism">en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism</a></strong> - A euphemism is a mild or polite way of referring to something that is unpleasant or embarrassing. Its purpose is to avoid offending the people who hear or read it.<br></p>
<p><strong><a href="#figs_hendiadys">en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys</a></strong> - In hendiadys a single idea is expressed with two words connected with “and,” when one word could be used to modify the other.<br></p>
<p><strong><a href="#figs_hyperbole">en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole</a></strong> - A hyperbole is a deliberate exaggeration used to indicate the speaker’s feeling or opinion about something.<br></p>
<p><strong><a href="#figs_idiom">Idiom</a></strong> - An idiom is a group of words that has a meaning that is different from what one would understand from the meanings of the individual words.<br></p>
<p><strong><a href="#figs_irony">Irony</a></strong> - In irony, a speaker repeats what someone has (or could have) said or thought, but he expects the listeners to understand from the context that he does not agree with it.<br></p>

<h1 id="figs_metaphor">Metaphor</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is a metaphor?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#figs_intro">Figures of Speech</a><br></p>
<p>A metaphor is a figure of speech that creates a 'word picture' by relating one thing (the topic of the metaphor) to an unrelated object. Metaphors imply (or state directly) that the two things have something in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words ‘like’ and ‘as’ are not used to show it. (See <a href="#figs_simile">Simile</a>.). A metaphor transfers an image from one familiar object to another object that is less easily understood. <br></p>
<p>For example, &quot;Life is a journey,&quot; is a metaphor that helps convey a concept about life - that it is like a journey in some way - perhaps because in both you are always moving along and progressing, not staying in the same place. In this example, &quot;life&quot; is the topic, &quot;a journey&quot; is the image that is being applied to the topic, and the concept of movement or progression is the point of similarity. Every metaphor has a topic, an image, and a point of similarity. But as with this example, usually the point of similarity is not stated. Often the author expects the reader or hearer to think about the comparison and see the point of similarity for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Purposes of Metaphor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One purpose of metaphor is to teach about something that is unknown by indicating that it is similar to something that is already known.</li>
<li>Another purpose of metaphor is to emphasize that something has a particular trait or to indicate that it has that particular trait in an extreme way.</li>
<li>Another purpose of metaphor is to lead people to react emotionally to one thing as they would to another.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Translation Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
<li>If the image in the original is unknown to your people, use an image from your own culture. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times. We don't want to have comparisons to things that had not been invented when the books of the Bible were first written.</li>
<li>Or if the image in the original is unknown to your people, simply state the point of similarity without using an image.</li>
<li>If it would be unclear to your readers how the topic is like the image, you can state the point of similarity clearly. However, do not do this if it was also not clear to the original audience.</li>
<li>If the topic is not stated clearly in the original and it would be unclear to your readers what the topic is, state the topic clearly. However, do not do this if the topic was not clear to the original audience. For example, in Matthew 16:6, Jesus told his disciples &quot;Beware of the <strong>yeast</strong> of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&quot; His disciples thought he was talking about bread, but Jesus was warning them about the <strong>teaching</strong> of the Pharisees and Sadducees. That was the topic, but it was unstated, and the disciples did not understand it at first. If the metaphor were fully stated, it would be, &quot;The teaching of the Pharisees is like yeast.&quot; the point of similarity is that they both spread throughout whatever they touch and change it.</li>
<li>If the target audience would not understand the metaphor, then change the metaphor to a simile by adding &quot;like&quot; or &quot;as&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples from the Bible</h2>
<p><strong>Jesus said to them. “I am the <strong>bread of life</strong>. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who trusts in me will never be thirsty.&quot;</strong> John 6:35</p>
<p>Jesus compared himself to bread, a food that people ate all the time then. Just as people need to eat food in order to have physical life, people need to trust in Jesus in order to have spiritual life.</p>
<p><strong>… <strong>the rising sun will</strong> come from heaven to help us, <strong>to shine</strong> on those who sit in <strong>darkness</strong> and the <strong>shadow of death</strong>.</strong> Luke 1:78b-79a</p>
<p>This verse has several related metaphors. The Savior is compared to the rising sun, teaching spiritual truth is compared to the sun shining, lacking spiritual truth is compared to sitting in darkness, and the fear of death is compared to a shadow. This means that just as the rising sun shines on those who have been living in darkness, the Savior will come and bring spiritual truth to those who lack spiritual truth and are afraid of death.</p>
<h2>Examples from English</h2>
<p><strong>He was a walking <strong>dictionary</strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Because he knows the meanings of so many words, he is compared to a dictionary. Dictionaries contain the meanings of many words.</p>
<p><strong>Her <strong>heart broke</strong> when her baby died.</strong></p>
<p>Her heart, or emotions, is compared to a physical thing that can break.</p>

<h1 id="figs_simile">Simile</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is a simile?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#figs_intro">Figures of Speech</a><br></p>
<p>In a simile something is compared to something else of a different kind in order to focus on a particular trait that they have in common. Unlike with metaphor, with simile the fact that there is a comparison is stated clearly with ‘like’ or ‘as.’</p>
<p><strong>Purposes of Simile</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One purpose of simile is to teach about something that is unknown by indicating that it is similar to something that is already known.</li>
<li>Another purpose is to emphasize that something has a particular trait or to indicate that it has that particular trait in an extreme way.</li>
<li>Similes also help you to form a picture in your mind of something; to experience what you are reading about more fully.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Translation Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
<li>If the image in the original is unknown to your people, use one from your own culture. Be sure that it is one that could have been used in the cultures of the Bible. We don't want to have comparisons to things that had not been invented when the books of the Bible were first written.</li>
<li>Or if the image in the original is unknown to your people, simply state the point of similarity without using an image.</li>
<li>If it would be unclear to your readers how the topic is like the image, you can state the point of similarity explicitly. However, do not do this if it was not clear to the original audience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples from the Bible</h2>
<p><strong>How often I wanted to gather your children together, <strong>as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings</strong>, but you refused!</strong> Luke 13:34b</p>
<p>In this simile, Jesus compared the protection he wanted to give the people of Jerusalem to the kind of protection a hen gives to her chicks when they are in danger. It's not that he would literally gather the people underneath him, but he would protect them and they would trust him.</p>
<p><strong>For as the lightning flashes in one part of the sky and shines to the other part of the sky, so will it be when the Son of Man comes in his day.</strong> Luke 17:24</p>
<p>Jesus did not say how his coming back to earth would be like when lightning flashes. But we can understand from the rest of the text that just as lighting flashes suddenly and everyone can see it, he will come suddenly and everyone will be able to see him. No one will have to be told about it.</p>
<h2>Examples from English</h2>
<p><strong>&quot;He is <strong>as crooked as a dog's hind leg</strong>.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Someone might say this about a businessman who is dishonest. English speakers associate truth with being straight and dishonesty with crookedness.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;She was <strong>as cool as a cucumber</strong>&quot;.</strong></p>
<p>Someone might say this about a person who doesn't get emotional in a very stressful situation. English speakers associate emotion with heat and lack of emotion with coolness.</p>

<h1 id="figs_rquestion">Rhetorical Question</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is a rhetorical question?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#figs_intro">Figures of Speech</a><br></p>
<p>A rhetorical question is a question that is used for something other than getting information. An answer is not expected for rhetorical questions. A rhetorical question may be used to express deep emotion or to encourage the reader to think deeply on a topic. At times, rhetorical questions are used for sarcasm, rebuking or scolding. Some languages have other purposes as well.</p>
<p>Watch the video on the <strong>'Kinds of Questions'</strong> for the <a href="http://youtu.be/ePSJS2RVoV4">computer</a> (http://youtu.be/ePSJS2RVoV4) or the <a href="http://youtu.be/7c-7LOqLBp4">tablet/phone</a> (http://youtu.be/7c-7LOqLBp4) to learn the difference between real and rhetorical questions.<br></p>
<h2>Translation Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Determine the purpose of the rhetorical question.</li>
<li>If your language would use a rhetorical question for that purpose, then use it.</li>
<li>Languages may have different forms of rhetorical questions for different purposes. For example, if a parent wants to scold or rebuke his child for writing on the walls, some languages could do it with different forms of rhetorical questions, such as: &quot;Why are you writing on the wall?&quot; or &quot;Who told you to write on the wall?&quot; or &quot;Is that <strong>your</strong> wall that you are writing on?&quot; Other languages would use a statement, such as: &quot;I told you not to write on the walls,&quot; or a command, such as: &quot;Do not write on the walls!&quot;</li>
<li>If, after determining the purpose of the rhetorical question, your decide that your language would use a statement or a command for that purpose, then use a statement or command instead of a rhetorical question. For example, in Mark 13:2, Jesus says to one of his disciples, &quot;Do you see these great buildings?&quot; (ULB). Jesus knows that the disciple sees them, but he uses a rhetorical question to draw attention to them. If your language would not use a rhetorical question to draw people's attention to something, then use whatever form is natural, such as a command, &quot;Look at these great buildings,&quot; or a statement, &quot;These buildings are very great.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples from the Bible</h2>
<p><strong>Zechariah said to the angel, &quot;How will I know this will happen? For I am an old man, and my wife also is very old.”</strong> Luke 1:18 (ULB)</p>
<p>When Zechariah asked this rhetorical question, he was indicating that he could not believe that what the angel said was true.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone who heard about this kept thinking about what had happened and said, “So then, what will this child become?” For they realized that the hand of the Lord was with him.</strong> Luke 1:66 (ULB)</p>
<p>The people were not expecting anyone to answer their question. They were simply expressing that they wondered about it because they were impressed by the surprising things they had heard about his birth.</p>
<h2>Examples from English</h2>
<p><strong>Could you do this for me?</strong></p>
<p>Someone could say this if they want to politely tell someone to do something.</p>
<p><strong>What possessed you to think of doing that?</strong></p>
<p>A mother might scold her child by saying this.</p>

<p>This module answers the question: What is an idiom?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#figs_intro">Figures of Speech</a><br></p>
<p>An idiom is a group of words that has a meaning that is different from what one would understand from the meanings of the individual words.</p>
<h2>Translation Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the original idiom if it would be clearly understood in your language.</li>
<li>Use a different idiom that people use in your own language that has the same meaning.</li>
<li>Translate the meaning plainly without using an idiom.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples from the Bible</h2>
<p><strong>But I have <strong>a baptism to be baptized with</strong>, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!</strong> Luke 12:50 (WEB)</p>
<p>A &quot;baptism to be baptized with&quot; is an idiom for suffering. Jesus meant that he would soon suffer greatly.</p>
<p><strong>Moses came near to the camp, and saw the calf and the dancing, and <strong>Moses' nose burned</strong>,</strong> Exo 32:19</p>
<p>&quot;His nose burned&quot; is a Hebrew idiom that means, &quot;He became angry.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>You are all <strong>sons of</strong> light, and <strong>sons of</strong> the day. </strong> 1 Thes 5:5a (WEB)</p>
<p>The phrase “sons of” is a Hebrew idiom used to refer to people who have certain characteristics. Jews used this idiom even when speaking Greek. &quot;Sons of light&quot; refers to people who live according to the truth.</p>
<h2>Examples from English</h2>
<p><strong>He saw the light.</strong> \ means &quot;He finally understood.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>It cost an arm and a leg.</strong> \ means &quot;It was very expensive.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Let's play it by ear.</strong> \ means &quot;Let's improvise&quot; or &quot;Let's see what happens and make decisions based on that.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>She had butterflies in her stomach.</strong> \ means &quot;She was nervous.&quot;</p>

<h1 id="figs_irony">Irony</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is irony?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#figs_intro">Figures of Speech</a><br></p>
<p>Irony is using words that appear to say the opposite of what you mean. Irony is typically used to be humorous or to place emphasis on how different something is from what it should be, or how far someone's belief is from the truth. Irony makes these points more powerfully than direct statements do. In irony, sometimes a speaker repeats what someone has (or could have) said or thought, but he expects the listeners to understand from the context that he does not agree with it.</p>
<h2>Translation Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
<li>If the irony would be understood correctly, translate it as is.</li>
<li>If the irony would not be understood correctly, you could indicate that the thoughts are not truly those of the speaker but of someone else. For example, In Mark 7:9, Jesus says to the Pharisees, &quot;Rightly you set aside the commandment of God in order to set up your own tradition.&quot; Jesus is putting into words what the Pharisees actually do, even though they would never admit that they do this. Everyone who hears this, including Jesus, knows that it is wrong to set aside a commandment of God. So Jesus is rebuking the Pharisees in a powerful way by using words that seem to commend them for doing wrong. If the irony would not be understood, this could be translated as &quot;You think you have done well in following your traditions. But as you do that, you have rejected God's commandments.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples from the Bible</h2>
<p><strong>Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?”</strong> Luke 22:64b (WEB)</p>
<p>The soldiers were hitting Jesus and they told him to prophecy and say who hit him. This was irony. They were implying that if he were a prophet, he should be able to tell who hit him, but they did not believe that he was a real prophet. They told him to prophecy because they were mocking him and wanted to prove that he was not really a prophet.</p>
<p>If the irony would not be understood here, the soldier's words could be translated more directly as, &quot;You are not a prophet - you cannot even tell us who struck you.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>When Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</strong> Mark 2:17a (WEB)</p>
<p>When Jesus spoke here of righteous people, that was irony. Jesus knew that there are no righteous people. But some people thought that they really were righteous, and they didn't think that Jesus should allow sinners to follow him. But Jesus invited sinners to go to him and turn from their sins. He was not inviting people who think they are righteous and think that they do not need to turn from their sins. Only people who know that they are sinners would repent of their sins.</p>
<p>If the irony would not be understood here, part of Mark 2:17 could be translated as &quot;I have not come to call those who think they are righteous to repentance, but those who know they are sinners.&quot;</p>
<h2>Examples from English</h2>
<p><strong>&quot;The used-car salesman told me that this car was a great bargain at only $1000, so I bought it. But now I find out that the radiator doesn't work, and it will cost me $4000 to get it repaired. <strong>Great bargain. Yeah, right</strong>.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>In this example, the speaker uses irony to express that the reality of the car was totally different than what the car salesman said, so he repeats the car salesman's words, but now mocking them as false.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Thanks for holding the door open for me.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>This would be an ironic statement made to someone who did not hold the door open for the speaker. It expresses that the other person should have been kind enough to hold it open, and that the speaker is annoyed with that person for not doing that. The expression of thanks for something that both the hearer and the speaker know that the hearer did not do has become, through irony, a rebuke for not doing it.</p>

<h1 id="figs_123person">First, Second or Third Person</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is first, second or third person?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#figs_intro">Figures of Speech</a><br></p>
<p>Watch the video for the <a href="http://youtu.be/HEqz6XDzyGM">computer</a> (http://youtu.be/HEqz6XDzyGM) or the <a href="http://youtu.be/BXhL5s2BY2U">tablet/phone</a> (http://youtu.be/BXhL5s2BY2U).<br></p>
<p>First person is how a speaker normally refers to himself. English has the first person pronouns ”I” and ”we” (Also: me, my, mine, us, our, ours).</p>
<p>Second person is how a speaker normally refers to the person or people he is speaking to. English uses the second person pronoun ”you” (Also: your, yours).</p>
<p>Third person is how a speaker normally refers to someone else. English has the third person pronouns &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;it&quot; and &quot;they&quot; (Also: him, his, her, hers, its, them, their, theirs).</p>
<p>Sometimes people use the third person to refer to themselves or to the people they are speaking to. See the examples of this from the Bible below. In some languages, first, second, and third person are shown with a prefix or suffix on a word. In some of these languages, using a pronoun in addition to the prefix or suffix indicates a special emphasis on the person or thing it refers to.</p>
<h2>Translation Suggestions</h2>
<p>Do what is natural and accurate in your own language. If your language does not always use a pronoun, do not use one simply because the source language does.</p>
<p>It is important to note that sometimes in the Bible the text changes from writing in the first person to the third person, but still talking about the same individual. That might be unnatural and confusing in your language. If so, then translate with one or the other but maintain accuracy and clarity.</p>

<p>Sometimes people use the third person to refer to themselves or to the people they are speaking to.</p>
<p><em>When a person refers to himself in the third person, you may be able to add a first person pronoun for clarification. For example:</em></p>
<p>But David said to Saul, &quot;Your servant used to keep his father’s sheep.&quot; (1 Samuel 17:34a, ULB)</p>
<p><em>In this example from 1 Samuel 17:34, David was speaking to King Saul about himself. He used the third person when he referred to himself as “your servant” and “his.” He was calling himself Saul's servant in order to show his humility toward Saul. </em></p>
<p>If it does not make sense in your language for someone to refer to himself in the thrid person, you could translate like this:</p>
<p>But David said to Saul, “<strong>I, your servant</strong>, used to keep <strong>my</strong> father’s sheep.”\ <strong>1 Samuel 17:34a</strong></p>
<p><em>In this next example from Job, God speaks, first calling himself “I” then referring to himself in the third person with the words “God's” and “his.” He did this to emphasize the he is God and he is powerful. But if this does not communicate well in your language, you may need to use first person references in those places, such as, &quot;mine.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Job 40:6-9</strong> ‘Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm: “Brace yourself like a man; <strong>I</strong> will question you, and you shall answer <strong>me</strong>. Would you discredit <strong>my</strong> justice? Would you condemn <strong>me</strong> to justify yourself? Do you have an arm like <strong>God’s</strong>, and can your voice thunder like <strong>his</strong>?”</p>
<p><em>Sometimes people use the third person when referring to the people they are speaking to after they say &quot;each of you.&quot; Jesus used the second person when he called the group of people he was speaking to &quot;<strong>You</strong> hypocrites.&quot; However, after he said &quot;each of you,&quot; he then used a third person pronoun (&quot;his&quot;) to refer to each of them. In those cases some languages might need to use a second person pronoun (&quot;your”) in that place to keep the meaning clear.</em></p>
<p>Luke 13:15 Then the Lord answered him, “<strong>You</strong> hypocrites! Does not <strong>each of you</strong> on the Sabbath untie <strong>his</strong> ox or <strong>his</strong> donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it?&quot;</p>
<h2>Examples from English</h2>
<p>First person ~ “I gave the dog a bone.”</p>
<p>Second person ~ “You gave the dog a bone.”</p>
<p>Third person ~ “She gave the dog a bone.”</p>

<h1 id="figs_order">Word Order</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: Is word order important?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#figs_intro">Figures of Speech</a><br></p>
<h2>Parts of a Sentence</h2>
<p>A basic sentence has three important parts: subject, object, and verb. Both subjects and objects are usually nouns (i.e. a person, place, thing, or idea). Verbs show action or a &quot;state of being.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>The subject of a sentence is what the sentence is about.</li>
<li>The subject (which will be a noun: a person, place, thing, or idea) is usually the main “actor” in a sentence.</li>
<li>The “actor” or subject usually does some action or is being described in some way.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the subject is identified, determine what it is doing (or what is happening to it). * A subject may be active: it can <strong>perform</strong> or <strong>do</strong> something such as “sing,” or “work,” or “teach.”<br />
 * A subject can be in a <strong>state</strong> such as “happy,” “sad,” or “mad.”<br />
 * Or a subject may have something done to it. * For example, “The ball was thrown.” (The ball is the subject.)</p>
<p>The object of a sentence is a recipient (that is NOT the subject). The object will also be a person, place, thing, or idea.</p>
<p>In a simple sentence the subject usually does something to or towards an object. Consider the sentence:</p>
<p>'<em>The boy kicked the ball</em>.'</p>
<p>The boy is the <strong>subject</strong>; the recipient or <strong>object</strong> is the ball. The subject (boy) does some <strong>action</strong> (kicked) to the object (ball).The VERB tells what the action is that the subject is doing (or being).</p>
<p>Often it is easy to find the verb, because one looks for the action occurring in the sentence.</p>
<h2>Translation Suggestions</h2>
<p>All languages have a preferred word order. Translate sentences so that they are accurate and have a smooth flow.</p>
<p>Word order or patterns can vary if the sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>is a question</li>
<li>has descriptive words</li>
<li>has a place in it</li>
<li>has time in it</li>
<li>has a condition in it, such as the word “if”</li>
<li>is a poem</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes the word order will also vary if there is a special type of emphasis. For example, perhaps in your language there is a special way to ask a rhetorical question or give a command. Knowing the preferred word order of the source text and how it is different than the target language can help a translator in translating from that language into the target language. This is especially true if your language does not have the same pattern. If the two languages have a different preferred word order for communicating the same things, then you will need to rephrase the sentence into the order that is preferred in the target language in order to make your translation sound natural. The translator’s goal is always to use natural language to make the meaning clear.</p>
<h2>Language Examples</h2>
<p>Now we will look at the importance of word order.</p>
<h4>English:</h4>
<p>In English, “The boy kicked the ball”. “The boy” is the subject, “kicked” is the verb, and “the ball” is the object.</p>
<p>This is the basic word order that English uses to communicate statements. First we say the subject, then the verb, and then the object. We can represent the Subject, Verb and Object with the letters “S”, “V” and “O”. So, we can call English an <strong>SVO</strong> Language.</p>
<h4>Japanese, Chines, Dutch and Turkish</h4>
<p>In the Japanese, Chinese, Dutch, and Turkish languages usually the subject is first, and then the object comes next, followed by the verb.</p>
<p>So the basic word order for a simple sentence for these languages is: Subject – Object – Verb, or SOV.</p>
<h4>Hebrew and Arabic</h4>
<p>In the Hebrew and Arabic languages, the order for sentences is normally Verb – Subject – Object, or VSO.</p>
<p>In order to translate from one of these languages into another, it is very important to change the order of the sentence into the preferred order for the target language. Only by doing this will the translation be natural and clear.</p>

<h1 id="figs_you">Forms of You</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What are the different forms of you?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#figs_intro">Figures of Speech</a><br></p>
<h2>Singular / Dual / Plural</h2>
<p>Some languages have more than one word for ‘you’ depending on how many people are being spoken to. If they are speaking to one person, they use the ‘singular’ form of &quot;you.&quot; If they are speaking to more than one person, they use the &quot;plural&quot; form of &quot;you.&quot; Some languages have a &quot;dual&quot; form for speaking to two people and some have other forms for speaking to three or four people.</p>

<h2>Formal / Informal</h2>
<p>Some languages also have different forms of &quot;you&quot; to indicate respect or social distance. They use the formal form of &quot;you&quot; when addressing someone who is an elder or respected or in authority. They use the informal &quot;you&quot; when talking with a peer or someone with less authority. Because the Bible was written in languages that do not have this difference, the translator will need to decide when it is best to use formal or informal forms of the language.</p>

<h1 id="figs_youdual">Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How do I know if the word 'you' is dual or plural?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#figs_you">Forms of You</a><br></p>
<h2>Forms of &quot;You&quot; in the Bible</h2>
<p>The Bible was first written in the Hebrew and Greek languages. These languages both have a singular form of you and a plural form of you. Therefore we know when each &quot;you&quot; in the Bible should be <a href="#figs_yousingular">'singular'</a> or plural. But even when reading the Bible in a language that does not have distinct singular and plural forms of &quot;you,&quot; the context will often make it clear whether the word “you” is intended to refer to one person, to two people, or to more than two people. If the target language has a dual form of &quot;you&quot; that is used for speaking to only two people, the translator will need to decide from the context when it is appropriate to use this form.<br></p>
<p>Some languages, like English, have only one word for ‘you’ regardless of how many people are being spoken to. English speakers can refer to one person as ‘you’ or to many people as ‘you.’ Often the context will make it clear as to whether the word ‘you’ refers to one person or more than one. Looking at the other pronouns in the sentence will help you distinguish the number of people who are being spoken to.</p>
<p>Some languages have more than one word for ‘you’ depending on how many people are being spoken to. If they are speaking to one person, they use the ‘singular’ form of ‘you’. If they are speaking to more than one person, they use the <a href="#figs_youdual">‘plural’</a> form of ‘you.’ Some languages have a <a href="#figs_youdual">‘dual’</a> form for speaking to two people and some have other forms for speaking to three or four people.<br></p>
<h2>Translation Suggestions</h2>
<p>Note that for many languages, the decision about what form of the pronoun to use will also affect the form of the verb associated with it, even in cases where the word “you” is not expressed (for example when a command is given).</p>
<h2>Examples from the Bible</h2>
<p><strong>Mark 10:35-36 <em>And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.” And [Jesus] said to them, “What do <strong>you</strong> want me to do for <strong>you</strong>?”</em></strong></p>
<p>Jesus is asking the <strong>two</strong>, James and John, what they want him to do for them. If the target language has a dual form of &quot;you,&quot; it would be appropriate to use it here. If the target language does not have a dual form, then the plural form would be appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Mark 11:1-2 <em>…Jesus sent two of his disciples, saying to them, “Go to the village ahead of <strong>you</strong>, and just as <strong>you</strong> enter it, <strong>you</strong> will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</em></strong></p>
<p>The context makes it clear that Jesus is addressing two persons, so the dual form of “you” would be used here in languages that make that distinction. Here the verbs “go” and “untie” would also need the dual form.</p>
<p>In instructional text, the “you” is often <strong>plural</strong> since it is addressing a wide audience. Here is an example:</p>
<p><strong>1 Peter 1:17 <em>Since <strong>you</strong> call on a Father who judges each man’s work impartially, live <strong>your</strong> lives as strangers here in reverent fear.</em></strong></p>

Sell everything <strong>you</strong> have and give to the poor, and <strong>you</strong> will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</em></strong></p>
<p>Note that even though English does not have singular and plural forms of ‘you’, the context indicates that this word ‘you’ here only refers to one person. The man had just told Jesus “<strong>I</strong> have observed these things” and Jesus responded with “you”, referring only to that one man.</p>
<p><strong>Acts 12:8 <em>Then the angel said to him, “Put on <strong>your</strong> clothes and sandals.” And Peter did so. “Wrap <strong>your</strong> cloak around <strong>you</strong> and follow me,” the angel told him.</em></strong></p>
<p>The context makes it clear that the angel is addressing one person, so the singular form of “you” would be used here in languages that make that distinction. The verbs “put on“ and “wrap” would also need the singular form.</p>
<p><strong>Titus 1:2,5; 2:1 <em>To Titus, my true son in our common faith…The reason I left <strong>you</strong> in Crete was that <strong>you</strong> might straighten out what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed <strong>you</strong>….<strong>You</strong> must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine.”</em></strong></p>
<p>Sometimes instruction is addressed to only one person, so the singular form of “you“ would be used. The context will make that clear. This often happens in a letter.</p>

<h1 id="figs_explicit">Explicit and Implicit</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What do the words explicit and implicit mean?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#figs_intro">Figures of Speech</a><br></p>
<p>There are two different forms of communication found in both written and spoken messages. One is called <strong><em>explicit</em></strong> and the other is called <em><strong>implicit</strong></em>. When a speaker, or writer, has a message to give, he has a particular audience in mind as he gives the message. This affects the form of his message and his decision on what information to include or leave out.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Information that the speaker states clearly is called <strong><em>explicit</em></strong> information. This is the information that the speaker or writer has decided to include in what he says.</p></li>
<li><p>Information that the speaker does not state clearly is called <em><strong>implicit</strong></em>information. This is the information that the speaker or writer expects his audience to already know, and so he knows that he does not need to include that information in what he writes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When a writer writes, he has in mind a certain audience who will read what he writes. The writer has a good idea of what this audience does and does not know about what he is writing about, and so the writer chooses to include the important information that he knows his audience does not know. He chooses to not include the information that his audience already knows.</p>
<p>Although implicit information is not stated in words but is only implied, it is information that the hearer or reader needs to know if he is to understand the meaning of the message. The speaker or writer has succeeded in communicating his message only if the hearer or reader correctly understands what was clearly stated as well as what was implied.</p>
<p>When we translate the Bible, we are making it available to a new audience. This new audience will know some things about what is in the Bible, but often they will not know some of the implicit information that the original writer left out because his original audience already knew it. The new target audience, then, will need to know some of that implicit information in order to understand some parts of the text. So in order for the Bible to communicate its message successfully, the translator needs to include some of the information that the original writer left as implicit for the original audience. If this information can be included in just a few words, then the translator may decide to include this information in the text of the translation. But if it will take more than a few words, it is best to include this information in a footnote. The translator will need to think about his target audience and decide when to include some of this implicit information. Checking the translation with the community is a good way for the translator to find out where he needs to include some implicit information so that they can understand the translation.</p>

<h1 id="figs_explicitinfo">Making Implicit Information Explicit</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How do I make implicit information explicit?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#figs_explicit">Explicit and Implicit</a><br></p>
<p>When a writer writes a message, he includes the information that his audience needs to know, and leaves out the information that he knows that they already know. When we translate a message, such as the Bible, for a new audience, they may not know some of that information that the original writer did not say. That is the implicit information. So in the places where the target audience needs to know the implicit information in order to understand the text, and they do not know it, you must put it in the translation, either in the text or in a footnote.</p>
<p>But translators need to be particularly sensitive when thinking about adding such information to the translation that is not stated explicitly in the source text because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes there will be things that are intentionally unclear in the text. In those cases, the translator must keep it unclear also in the translation.</li>
<li>It is not necessary to include all implicit information for the target audience to understand the text. There is a lot of information that the original audience knew about the things that are in the Bible. Only include the information that the target audience needs to know so that the message is clear, nothing more. The translator's goal should be to make sure that the reader understands the original meaning of the message. The translation should always have the same meaning as the source text, not more meaning, not less meaning, and not different meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implicit information may be made explicit in order to make the translation clear if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the implicit information that the original audience would have known is made explicit,</li>
<li>the added information is necessary so that the target audience will understand the main point of the message,</li>
<li>The translation would communicate no meaning or a wrong meaning without the added information,</li>
<li>No new information is added that is not part of the original message (do not add something just because you read it in a commentary),</li>
<li>the added information does not change the meaning, making it no longer true or accurate,</li>
<li>the added information is suitable to the original situation in which the message was given. As always, you need to ask yourself if your translation is communicating accurately and clearly what the original message was saying.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples from the Bible</h2>
<p><strong>Ruth 2:14</strong> <em>She ate all that she wanted and had some left over.</em></p>
<p>Some languages may need to add an object where English (or whatever source language is being used) doesn't have one. Here, the implied object is &quot;roasted grain&quot; or simply &quot;food.&quot; If the target language requires an object for these verbs, you could translate, <em>She ate all <strong>the roasted grain</strong> that she wanted and had some <strong>food</strong> left over.</em></p>
<p><strong>Genesis 11:5 </strong> <em>So Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower which the descendants of Adam had built.</em></p>
<p>The phrase &quot;came down&quot; refers to <strong>where</strong> he came from. The place he came from was understood by the original readers. But if this sentence is unclear for the target audience, you may name the place to make the information explicit as in: <em>So Yahweh came down <strong>from heaven</strong> to see the city and the tower which the descendants of Adam had built.</em></p>
<p><strong>Genesis 14:3</strong> <em>These latter five kings joined together in the valley of Siddim (also called the Salt Sea).</em></p>
<p>The information that the armies of the five kings were with these five kings was understood by the original readers. But if this information is not understood by the target audience, the information that their armies were with them can be made explicit: “These latter five kings <strong>and their armies</strong> joined together....”</p>
<p><strong>Genesis 4:18</strong> <em>To Enoch was born Irad. Irad became the father of Mehujael.</em></p>
<p>It is stated explicitly that Enoch had a child named Irad and that Irad had a child named Mehujael. The implied information is that Irad grew up to be a man and married a woman and through her, had a son. If the verse is confusing without this information for the target audience, you may add as much information as is necessary, such as, &quot;Enoch grew up and married and became the father of a son whom he named Irad. When Irad grew up he became the father of a son whom he named Mehujael.&quot;</p>
<h2>Examples from English</h2>
<ul>
<li>David asks Susan: “Where is Joe?” David’s question is explicit because it is clearly stated and easily understood by Susan.</li>
<li>Susan answers, “At work.” Susan’s response leaves out who she is talking about - this information is implicit. But David understands that information and that her message is, in fact, “Joe is at work.”</li>

<h1 id="figs_hypo">Hypothetical Situations</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What are hypothetical situations?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#figs_intro">Figures of Speech</a><br></p>
<p>Something that is hypothetical is 'assumed' or 'supposed.' A hypothetical situation is a possible scenario from any point in time: past, present or future. A hypothetical situation in the past did not happen, but could have happened under different circumstances. A hypothetical situation in the present or future may or may not actually happen - the speaker presents it as hypothetical because he does not know or it depends on the actions of others. It could possibly happen or it may never happen. A hypothetical situation might mean asking a “what if” question. It might be a “suppose” or “if only” statement. Hypothetical situations are good teaching tools. Jesus often used them in his teaching.</p>
<h2>Translation Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
<li>How would your language express a situation that could never happen?</li>
<li>How would you communicate a “suppose” scenario that could happen right now? *How would your language express a situation that may or may not happen in the future?</li>
<li>Does your language have a special way of indicating a hypothetical situation in the past?</li>
<li>How does your language express an “if only” or “I wish” scenario which also implies some emotion?</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important in translation to be able to recognize a hypothetical situation in the text and use appropriate words or phrases. You may need to show the timing of the hypothetical situation (e.g. past, present or future). You may need to clarify that the scenario is only a possibility: that it might be true or not likely to be true; that it could possibly happen or would never happen. Hypothetical situations may or may not imply emotions or reasons. Some hypothetical statements may use expressions such as “what if”, “suppose” or “if only” to help the reader understand the type of hypothetical situation. Perhaps your language uses special wording or specific language structures to communicate each of these things.</p>
<h2>Examples from the Bible</h2>
<p>Consider a hypothetical situation that <strong>would never happen</strong>:</p>
<p>In Luke chapter 18 verse 25 Jesus was teaching his disciples about how being rich can make it hard to enter God’s kingdom. To emphasize this, he said that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to submit to God’s rule in their life.</p>
<p>The hypothetical part of this is that a large camel could never squeeze through the eye of a very small sewing needle! Jesus used this hypothetical scenario to emphasize his teaching point.</p>
<hr />
<p>Consider a “suppose” scenario that <strong>could possibly happen</strong>.</p>
<p>In Matthew chapter 12 verse 11, Jesus was pointing out to the religious leaders that they were not being honest when they judged people for working on the Sabbath day. He told them, “Suppose one of you has a sheep and it falls into a deep hole on the Sabbath day. Certainly, you would work to pull it out of the hole!”</p>
<p>Jesus wasn’t talking about a specific person who did this. Rather, he was talking about a possible situation which could and often did happen. He used the hypothetical story to help listeners understand his own work (God's work).</p>
<hr />
<p>The following is an example of a hypothetical scenario <strong>in the past</strong>:</p>
<p>In Matthew 11:21, Jesus said that <em>if the people living in the ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon had been able to see the miracles that he – Jesus – performed, they would have repented long ago.</em></p>
<p>This is a hypothetical situation that we know did not happen. Jesus was making the spiritual teaching point of “what if” these people had seen the miracles? If they had seen the miracles, then, they would have repented.</p>
<hr />
<p>Often a hypothetical situation in the past <strong>expresses an emotion, such as regret</strong>. For example, consider Exodus 16:3:</p>
<p>“<em>If only we had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt...</em>.”</p>
<p>Here the Israelites are afraid that they will have to suffer and die of hunger in the wilderness, and so they are wishing that they had stayed in Egypt and died there with full stomachs.</p>

<h1 id="figs_events">Order of Events</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: Is it important to have the order of events correct?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#figs_intro">Figures of Speech</a><br></p>
<p>In the Bible, events are not always told in the order in which they occurred. Sometimes the author wanted to discuss something that happened at an earlier time than the event that he just talked about. Many languages do this by using different tenses or time words such as ‘earlier,’ ‘last year,’ or ‘before that.’ Other languages prefer to state the events in the order that they occured to avoid confusion. For events that are told in the order in which they occured, it is also necessary in many languages to mark the order of events with connecting words such as &quot;after these things,&quot; &quot;having done this,&quot; or &quot;then.&quot; It is important to help your readers understand the correct order of events in a natural way when translating into your language.</p>
<h2>Translation Suggestions</h2>
<p>In order to make the order of events clear in the target language, it may be necessary at times to put some verses or parts of verses in a different order. When you put verses in a different order, you may need to combine the verse numbers so that the numbers can stay in the right order, such as labelling a chunk of two reordered verses as 5-6. You should only put verses in a different order when necessary to avoid confusion or wrong meaning. The translation should always be clear, accurate, and natural.</p>
<p>Pay close attention to time words such as, &quot;yesterday,&quot; &quot;last year,&quot; &quot;before,&quot; &quot;then,&quot; or &quot;next year.&quot; Make sure that you include all of the time words necessary for your audience to understand the order of events. It is also important that your audience understand clearly the order of arguments, such as reasons or causes. Some languages put the reasons or causes for things before the event or the main point of an argument, and other languages put reasons and causes after the main point or event. Use whichever order is natural for your language. It may also be helpful to use words such as, &quot;therefore&quot; or &quot;because.&quot;</p>
<h2>Examples from the Bible</h2>
<p>Following the Greek wording, the English Standard Version of Luke 10:34 says, <em><strong>“He (The Samaritan) went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine&quot;</strong></em> (ESV). This could sound like the Samaritan bandaged the wounds and then poured oil and wine on the bandages or that he did all of this at the same time. To make the order of what happened more clear, you might consider rearranging the phrases in this sentence to read, <em><strong>“The Samaritan went to him, poured oil and wine on his wounds, and put bandages on them.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Sometimes to emphasize a point or highlight a contrast between two events, the Bible text presents things in a different order than they occurred. The ESV of Luke 8:37-38 says, <em><strong>37 “…So he (Jesus) got into the boat and returned (to the other side of the lake). 38 The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying...” </strong> </em> In verse 37, it sounded like Jesus had already left in the boat, but in the next verse the man is talking to him. We need to understand that the man spoke to Jesus before Jesus left. Luke first talked about the people begging Jesus to leave and Jesus' response to them in verse 37, then he talked about the man begging Jesus to go with him and Jesus' response to the man in verse 38. Luke is showing us the contrast between the two kinds of people. This is a Greek language pattern that is not natural in English because the events are out of order. Some languages will have to make the order of events clear by saying, <em><strong>“Before Jesus left, the man said to him….” </strong></em>Other languages may need to switch the order of the verses: 37-38 <em><strong>The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying...then he got into the boat and returned (to the other side of the lake)”.</strong> </em></p>
<h2>Examples from English</h2>
<p>Typically people start each day by doing the same steps. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wake up</p></li>
<li><p>Get out of bed</p></li>
<li><p>Get dressed</p></li>
</ul>
<p>English prefers telling events in the order that they occur. So for English we would not say, “Every morning I get dressed, wake up, and get out of bed.” The preferred order would be, “Every morning when I wake up, I get out of bed and get dressed.”</p>

<h1 id="figs_parables">Parables</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is a parable?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#figs_intro">Figures of Speech</a><br></p>
<p>The kind of communication that we call &quot;parable&quot; includes narrative stories, metaphors, similes, proverbs, and even riddles. The intent of a parable is to convey meaning through a story or word picture. A parable is not an actual account of an event; it is more like an imaginary or hypothetical example (e.g. This could happen). It can be used to explain the kingdom of Heaven by telling a story which the listeners can understand. Because the lesson comes in the form of a story, the listener or reader can feel themselves being a part of it; it is more likely to make an impact on their lives.</p>
<h2>Translation Suggestions</h2>
<p>Parables or teaching stories are best translated as closely as possible to the way they were originally told. Because the parables are set in the culture of Bible times, there may be things that are not easily understood by a modern audience. Follow the guidelines for translating unknown practices or things. But because these are parables and not real events, some things that are known to the target audience can be substituted for things that are unknown to them, as long as they existed in the time period. Parables are best translated as a situation that can be understood within your own culture. The parable is a teaching story, so it is important that all of the details and parts of the story support the main point of the story. It is important that you understand this main point of the parable before you translate it.</p>
<p>When Jesus told a parable, he did not always intend for his hearers to understand what it meant right away (for example, the parable of the farmer planting seeds). So do <strong>not</strong> try to explain the story or what Jesus was teaching, but simply translate the parable. Use the form that your language has for communicating that a narrative is an imaginative story (or even a story whose purpose is to teach something) and not an account of a historical event.</p>
<p>Parables seldom (if ever) contain the names of specific individuals (That may be a key for you in identifying what is a parable and what is a narrative account.) (See: <a href="#figs_simile">Simile</a>, <a href="#figs_metaphor">Metaphor</a>, <a href="#figs_hypo">Hypothetical Situations</a>)<br></p>
<h2>Examples from the Bible</h2>
<p><strong>Luke 4:23</strong> <em>Jesus said to them, &quot;Certainly you will say this <strong>proverb</strong> to me, 'Doctor, heal yourself. Whatever we heard that you did in Capernaum, do it here in your hometown too.'&quot; ULB</em></p>
<p><strong>Luke 6:39</strong> <em>Then he also told them a <strong>parable</strong>. &quot;Can a blind person guide another blind person? If he did, they would both fall into a pit, would they not? ULB</em></p>

<h1 id="intro_check">Introduction to the Checking Manual</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is the Checking Manual?</p>
<h2>Translation Checking Manual</h2>
<p>This manual describes how to check translated biblical content for accuracy, clarity, and naturalness.</p>
<p><strong><em>Volume One</em> </strong></p>
<p>Volume One contains instructions for checking the translation that the translation team will use to check each other's work. If they follow these instructions, they will complete checking level one. Volume One also contains instructions for the translation team to use for checking the translation with the language community for clarity and naturalness, and for church leaders to use when they check the translation for accuracy. If they follow these instructions, they will complete checking level two.</p>
<p><strong><em>Volume Two</em> </strong></p>
<p>Volume Two contains further instructions for checking the translation that the church leaders can use to check the translation. These instructions are also for the leaders of church networks to use for checking the translation. Because many leaders of church networks do not speak the language of the translation, Volume Two also contains instructions for creating a back translation, which allows people to check a translation in a language that they do not speak.</p>

<h1 id="intro_checking">Introduction to Translation Checking</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: Why do we do translation checking?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#intro_check">Introduction to the Checking Manual</a><br></p>
<h2>Translation Checking</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>As part of the translation process, it is necessary that several people check the translation to make sure that it is clearly communicating the message that it should communicate. A beginning translator who was told to check his translation once said, “But I speak my native language perfectly. The translation is for that language. What more is needed?” What he said was true, but there are two more things to keep in mind. One thing is that he may not have understood the text correctly, and so someone who knows what it should say might be able to correct the translation. This would be someone who knows the Bible well, such as a Bible teacher or a Bible translation checker. The other thing is that, although he may know very well what the text should say, the way he translated it might mean something else to a different person. That is, another person might think that the translation is talking about something other than what the translator intended, or the person might not understand what the translator was trying to say. That is why it is always necessary to check what someone else understands from the translation so that we can make it more accurate and more clear.</p>
<p>This is a guide to the process of checking, in the form of a scale with three levels.</p>
<p>This checking scale helps to show the extent to which the accuracy and clarity of a translation have been verified. These checking levels have been developed by the <strong><a href="https://unfoldingword.org">unfoldingWord network</a> (https://unfoldingword.org)</strong>, the same group that manages Door43 with the help of many volunteers, and they are used to indicate the checking level of all biblical content on Door43.<br></p>
<h3>The Checking Levels</h3>
<p>There are three checking levels: <a href="#level1">Level One Check</a>, <a href="#level2">Checking Level Two – External Check</a>, and <a href="#level3">Checking Level Three - Authenticated Check</a>. Any translation that has not yet been checked to Level One is considered to have not been checked and is assigned no checking status.<br></p>
<p>The purpose of having several Checking Levels is to make translated materials quickly available to the church, while also allowing the content to continue to be checked and corroborated in an open environment. At all times, the degree to which its accuracy has been checked will be clearly indicated. We believe this will result in a faster checking process, allow broad church participation and ownership, and produce better translations.</p>
<p>Next we recommend you learn about: <a href="#intro_levels">Introduction to the Checking Levels</a><br></p>


<h1 id="intro_levels">Introduction to the Checking Levels</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How do the checking levels work?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#intro_checking">Introduction to Translation Checking</a><br></p>
<h3>How Checking Levels Work</h3>
<p>Here are some important tips to remember when working with Checking Levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only translations that have reached Checking Level One (Checking Level Two for Bible translations) or higher will be made available on the <a href="https://unfoldingword.org/stories">unfoldingWord website</a> (https://unfoldingword.org/stories) and the unfoldingWord mobile app.<br></li>
<li>Only translations that have reached Checking Level Three will be approved as source texts for other translations.</li>
<li>When a Checking Level has been completed and all appropriate edits have been made to door43, the checkers will inform unfoldingWord of the details of the check. unfoldingWord will harvest a copy of what is on door43, digitally publish a static copy of it on the <a href="https://unfoldingword.org/stories">unfoldingWord website</a> (https://unfoldingword.org/stories) and make it available on the unfoldingWord mobile app. A print-ready PDF will also be produced and made available for download. The checked version on door43 will remain fluid, allowing for future checking and editing.<br></li>
<li>For Open Bible Stories projects: Only Open Bible Stories translations that have been made from version 3.0 or higher of the English source text are eligible to be checked to Level One (or higher). Translations made from versions before 3.0 <a href="#obs_update">must be updated</a> before proceeding with Checking Levels.<br></li>
</ul>
<h3>The Checking Levels</h3>
<p>The strategy for quality assurance of unfoldingWord content, including Open Bible Stories, is described briefly here and in detail in the document <a href="http://distantshores.org/resources/whitepapers/quality-assurance">“Quality Assurance of Open-License Biblical Content”</a> (http://distantshores.org/resources/whitepapers/quality-assurance).<br></p>
<p>The three-level checking scale we use is dependent on the unfoldingWord <a href="#statement_of_faith">Statement of Faith</a> and <a href="#translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</a>. All translated content is compared against the theology of the Statement of Faith and against the procedures and methodologies of the Translation Guidelines. With these documents forming the foundation, these are the three levels of checking used in the unfoldingWord project:<br></p>
<p><a href="#level1">Checking Level One - Internal Check</a><br></p>
<p><a href="#level2">Checking Level Two - External Check</a><br></p>
<p><a href="#level3">Checking Level Three - Authenticated Check</a><br></p>
<h3>Checking the Checkers</h3>
<p>The process and checking framework described in this document depends on an ongoing process of checking and revising content, as determined by the Church that uses the content. Feedback loops are encouraged (and modeled in translation software, where feasible) with a view to maximizing input from the greatest number of users of the content. The translations of the content are made available on the <a href="http://door43.org">Door43</a> (http://door43.org) translation platform, which is designed to make it easy for users to collaboratively create content that increases in quality over time.<br></p>

<h2>How to Update a Previous Version of Open Bible Stories</h2>
<p>In an effort to ensure the highest quality resource possible with the highest level of accuracy to the Bible, several revisions have been made to Open Bible Stories through the years. Sometimes translations have been made off of a previous version. It is our desire that every translation be updated to the latest, best version of Open Bible Stories.</p>
<h3>Definition of a Version of Open Bible Stories</h3>
<p>A version of Open Bible Stories refers to a variation in the text itself that differs from an earlier form of the same text.</p>
<p>Versions are indicated by two or three numbers separated by periods (e.g. 2.0 or 3.1.2).</p>
<p>The purpose of using versions is to easily and consistently be able to differentiate between and communicate about variations and modifications Open Bible Stories has gone through.</p>
<h3>How Version Numbering Happens</h3>
<p>Open Bible Stories was written in English and remains the &quot;gold standard&quot; of Open Bible Stories. After Open Bible Stories was originally written, let's say it was version 1.0. Each major change after that bumped the translation up 0.1. So after the first major change after it was written, Open Bible Stories went from version 1.0 to version 1.1. For each minor change, a version is increased by 0.0.1. So let's say after the major change a minor change was then made, the version would increase from 1.1 to 1.1.1. Either after an especially large change or after a series of major changes, the version number is bumped up to the next level and &quot;resets&quot;. For instance, after version 1.1.1 if there was an especially large change, the next release would be 2.0.</p>
<p>In general, major changes constitute changes that have theological implications, restructuring of image and story order, or the changing of images. Minor changes include fixing typos and simple rewording that will not largely affect translations (e.g. changing &quot;unleavened bread&quot; to &quot;bread that is made without yeast&quot;).</p>
<p>Version Numbering for translations takes the version number of the source language and adds 0.1. So if somebody translates from English version 2.1.1, the translation would be version 2.2.1.</p>
<h3>Identify which Version of Open Bible Stories</h3>
<p>Many translations have the version number listed. You can find the version number in the side bar for whatever language you happen to be on in Door43.</p>
<p>Some translations, especially those done offline, do not have the version number. To figure out which version a particular translation is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check story #45. If it ends with Philip looking at the chariot then it is translated from version 1.0. If it ends with the Ethiopian Official smiling go to the next step.</li>
<li>Check 06-02. If the phrase &quot;to the land where Abraham's relatives lived&quot; is not included then it is translated from version 2.0. If it is included it is translated from at least version 3.0. (Also check 09-06, if &quot;in order to save him from being killed&quot; is not included it is translated from version 2.0. If it is included it is translated from at least version 3.0.)</li>
<li>If you are still not sure, we have created a complete set of all the changes between <a href="https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_1-to-ver_3.html">Version 1</a> or <a href="https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_2-to-ver_3.html">Version 2</a> and the current. Compare your translation to determine which version your translation was made off of. Note: All text highlighted in green has been added, highlighted in yellow has been changed, and highlighted in red has been deleted. Only frames that have changed are included.<br></li>
<li><p>To make sure you have all the latest changes, look at the <a href="https://door43.org/en/obs/change-log">change log</a> and make sure these changes have been made in your language.<br></p>
<h3>Update to the Latest Version of Open Bible Stories</h3>
<p>Once you have identified which version of Open Bible Stories your language is, you will need to update your language to the latest version. To help simplify the update process, we have generated change logs of all the changes that happened between <a href="https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_1-to-ver_3.html">version 1 and the latest</a> and <a href="https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_2-to-ver_3.html">version 2 and the latest</a>. Simply go through these changes and update the text according to those documents.<br></p></li>

<p>This module answers the question: How do I do a level one check?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#intro_levels">Introduction to the Checking Levels</a><br></p>
<h2>Checking Level One – Internal Check</h2>
<h3>Definition of Checking Level One</h3>
<p>Level One checking will be done primarily by the translation team, with some help from others in the language community. The translator or translation team should check their translation before they translate very many stories or chapters of the Bible, so that they can correct mistakes as early as possible in the translation process. Many of the steps in this process will need to be done several times before the translation is finished.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the unfoldingWord project, translations of Bible texts are only published once they achieve Level Two. Other biblical content is made available at Level One. This enables the broadest reach of the content as an active project, with an open invitation (implied or direct) to help improve the translation.</p>
<h3>Steps for checking under Level One (Internal):</h3>
<p>These are the steps that the translation team must follow in order to achieve Checking Level One:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact.</strong> Make contact with at least one element of the unfoldingWord network, notifying unfoldingWord that you intend to begin translation. To get information about how to do that, click <a href="#getting_started">here</a>.<br></li>
<li><strong>Review.</strong> Review the <a href="#statement_of_faith">Statement of Faith</a> and the <a href="#translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</a>.<br></li>
<li><strong>Agree.</strong> Agree that the Statement of Faith is an accurate reflection of your own beliefs and that you intend to translate the content in harmony with it and also in accordance with the Translation Guidelines by signing the form <a href="https://unfoldingword.org/license/">here</a> (https://unfoldingword.org/license).<br></li>
<li><strong>Draft.</strong> Make a draft translation of some portions of the text. For instructions on how to make a draft translation, click <a href="#first_draft">here.</a><br></li>
<li><strong>Self Check</strong>. For instructions on how to do a Self Check of your draft translation, click <a href="#self_check">here.</a><br></li>
<li><strong>Peer Check</strong>. For instructions on how to do a Peer Check of your draft translation, click <a href="#peer_check">here. </a><br></li>
<li><strong>Important Term Check</strong>. For instructions on how to do an Important Term Check of your draft translation, click <a href="#important_term_check">here. </a><br></li>
<li><strong>Accuracy Check</strong>. For instructions on how to do an Accuracy Check of your draft translation, click <a href="#accuracy_check">here. </a><br></li>
<li><strong>Affirmation</strong>. Affirm that you, as a translation team or individual, have made full use of the Translation Notes, the definitions of Important Terms, and the other exegetical and translation checking resources in the translation process, and that you have followed the steps for checking under Level One.</li>

<p>This module answers the question: How do I make a first draft?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#level1">Level One Check</a><br></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pray that God would help you to understand the passage that you are translating and that he would help you to find the best way to communicate that passage in your language.</p></li>
<li>If you are translating Open Bible Stories, read the entire story before starting to translate it. If you are translating the Bible, read the entire chapter before you start to translate any part of it. This way you will understand how the part you are translating fits into the larger context, and you will translate it better.</li>
<li>Read the passage that you plan to translate in as many different translations as you have. The ULB will help you to see the form of the original text, and the UDB will help you to understand the meaning of the original text. Think about how to communicate the meaning in the form that people would use in your language. Also read any Bible helps or commentaries that you have that talk about that passage.</li>
<li>Read the Translation Notes for the passage that you plan to translate.</li>
<li>Read the definitions of important terms in the list called &quot;translationWords&quot; for each highlighted word in the passage that you plan to translate.</li>
<li>Discuss the passage, the Translation Notes, and the important terms with others in the translation team.</li>
<li><p>When you understand well what the passage is saying, write down (or record) what it is saying in your language, in the way that someone from your language community would say it. Write down (or record) the whole passage (the chunk of text) without looking at the source text. This will help you to say these things in a way that is natural for your language, rather than in a way that was natural for the source language but that is not the best way to say it in your language.</p></li>

<li>If translating the Bible, compare your translation with other translations of the same Bible passage. If one of those makes you think of a better way to say something, then revise your translation in that way. If one of those helps you to understand something better than you did before, then change your translation so that it communicates the meaning better.</li>
<li><p>After these steps, read your translation out loud to yourself. Fix anything that does not sound like it is the way that someone from your community would say it. Sometimes parts of sentences need to be put in a different order.</p></li>

<li><p>Each time the important term occurs in the source text, make sure that the word you have chosen for the translation still makes sense in that context. If it does not, discuss the problem with others on the translation team and try to find a solution together. You may need to use a different term, or you may need to use more than one term for the different contexts, or you may need to find another way to communicate the important term, such as using a longer phrase.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>The people who do the Level One accuracy check can be members of the translation team, but they should <strong>not</strong> be the same people who translated the story or Bible passage that they are checking. They can also be members of the community who are not part of the translation team. They should be speakers of the language of the translation, be respected in the community, and, if possible, know the Bible well in the language of wider communication. The purpose of this step is to make sure that the translation accurately communicates the meaning of the original story or Bible passage. The checkers will be helping the translation team think about the best way to translate the meaning of the story or Bible passage in their own language. There can be one person who checks a story or Bible passage, or more than one. Having more than one person checking a story or passage can be helpful, because often different checkers will notice different things. The people doing the checking should follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each of the checkers should read the translation (or listen to the recording) by himself, comparing it to the original Bible passage or story in the language of wider communication. As the checker reads (or listens to) the translation and compares it to the original, he should keep in mind these general questions:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Does the translation add anything to the original meaning?</li>
<li>Is there any part of the meaning that is left out of the translation?</li>
<li>Has the translation changed the meaning in any way? In addition to these general questions, the checker should consider the questions for specific Open Bible Stories or Bible passages. Click for <a href="https://door43.org/en/obs/notes/questions/home">Open Bible Stories questions</a> or for <a href="https://door43.org/en/bible/questions/comprehension/home">Bible questions</a>. <br></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>The checker should make notes where he thinks there might be a problem or something to be improved.</p></li>
<li><p>After the checkers have done this individually, they should all meet with the translator or translation team and review the story or Bible passage together. As they come to the places where each checker made note of a problem or question, the checkers can ask their questions or make suggestions for improvement. As the checkers and the translation team discuss the questions and suggestions, they might think of other questions or new ways of saying things. This is good. As the checkers and the translation team work together, God will help them discover the best way to communicate the meaning of the story or Bible passage.</p></li>
<li><p>After the checkers and the translation team have decided what they need to change, the translation team will revise the translation.</p></li>
<li><p>After the translation team revises the translation, they should read it out loud to each other or to other members of the language community to make sure that it still sounds natural in their language.</p></li>
<li><p>The translator (or team) makes a note of any Bible passages that are still difficult to understand, and where they would like additional consultant help. These notes will be used by the church leaders and checkers in levels two and three, so that they can help the translators understand the meaning and communicate it more clearly.</p></li>

<p>This module answers the question: How can the language community help me check my work?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#level2">Checking Level Two – External Check</a><br></p>
<p>After you, the translation team, have performed the checks listed under Level One, you are ready to take the translation to the community so that you can check to see if it communicates the message clearly and naturally to them in the target language.</p>
<p>There are a set of questions and answers for each Open Bible Story and for each chapter of the Bible that you can use to test the translation to make sure that it is communicating clearly. <em><a href="https://door43.org/en/obs/notes/questions/home">Open Bible Stories questions are here</a><br> </em><a href="https://door43.org/en/bible/questions/comprehension/home">Bible questions are here</a>. <br> *If specific questions are not available, then use the <a href="#generalquestions">general questions available here</a>. <br></p>
<p>To use these questions, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Read the passage to one or more members of the language community who will answer the questions. These members of the language community must be people who have not been involved in the translation before. In other words, the community members who are asked the questions should not already know the answers to the questions from working on the translation or from previous knowledge of the Bible. We want them to be able to answer the questions only from hearing or reading the translation of the story or Bible passage. This is how we will know if the translation is communicating clearly or not. For this same reason, it is important that the community members not look at a Bible while they are answering these questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask the community members some of the questions for that passage, one question at a time. It is not necessary to use all of the questions for each story or chapter if it seems that the community members are understanding the translation well.</p></li>
<li><p>After each question, a member of the language community will answer the question. If the person only answers with a “yes” or a “no,” then the questioner should ask a further question so that he can be sure that the translation is communicating well. A further question could be something like, “How do you know that?” or “What part of the translation tells you that?”</p></li>
<li><p>Write down the answer that the person gives. If the person’s answer is similar to the suggested answer that has been provided for the question, then the translation of the story is clearly communicating the right information at that point. The answer does not have to be exactly the same as the suggested answer to be a right answer, but it should give basically the same information. Sometimes the suggested answer is very long. If the person answers with only part of the suggested answer, that is also a right answer.</p></li>
<li><p>If the answer is unexpected or very different than the suggested answer, or if the person cannot answer the question, then the translation team will need to revise the part of the translation that communicates that information so that it communicates the information more clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>After the translation team has revised the translation of the passage, then ask other members of the language community the same questions, that is, ask other speakers of the language who have not been involved in checking the same passage before. If they answer the questions correctly, then the translation is now communicating well.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat this process with each story or Bible chapter until members of the language community can answer the questions well, showing that the translation is communicating the right information clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to the Community Check Evaluation Page and answer the questions there.</p></li>

<p>This module answers the question: What are some other methods that I can use to check the translation?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#language_community_check">Language Community Check</a><br></p>
<h2>Other Checking Methods</h2>
<p>As well as asking questions, there are other checking methods that you may also use to ensure that the translation is easy to read and sounds natural to the listeners. Here are some other methods that you may like to try:</p>
<p>Retell Method: You, the translator can read a few verses and ask someone else to retell what was said. This helps to check the clarity and naturalness of the translation and offers alternate ways of saying the same thing.</p>
<p>Reading Method: Someone other than you, the translator, should read a portion of the translation while you take notes where the pauses and mistakes occur. This will show how easy or how difficult it is to read and understand the translation. Look at the places in the translation where the reader paused or made mistakes and consider what part of the translation was difficult. You may need to revise the translation at those points so that it is easier to read and understand.</p>
<p>Offer Alternate translations: In areas where you are not sure of the best way to express a word or phrase, ask other people for an alternative translation or offer a choice between two translations and see which alternative translation people think is the most clear.</p>
<p>Reviewer Input: Let others whom you respect read your translation. Ask them to take notes and tell you where it might be improved. Look for better word choices, natural expressions, and even spelling adjustments.</p>
<p>Discussion Groups: Ask people to read the translation aloud and to ask questions for clarification. Pay attention to the words they use, since alternate words and expressions come up when someone is trying to make sense of a difficult point, and these alternate words and expressions might be better than the ones in the translation.</p>

<p>When a language is first written the translator must decide how to indicate certain features of all written languages. These questions will give the wider community an understanding of some of the preliminary decisions made by the translator for writing the local language in the areas of punctuation, spelling and the writing of names in the Bible. The translation team and the community should agree on how to do this.</p>
<p>Does your language have a way of highlighting direct or quoted speech? How do you show it?</p>
<p>What guidelines have you followed for indicating verse numbering, quoted speech and Old Testament quotations? (Are you following the style of the national language? What variations have you decided to use to suit your language?)</p>
<p>Have you decided to indicate section headings? If you are using section headings, which kind has the translation team decided to use (see examples below)? How does the national language handle section headings? (Is the community satisfied with the decisions of the translation team?) Be sure to use a kind of section heading that the people will understand is not part of the text that it introduces.</p>
<p>Examples of section headings for Mark 2:1-12:</p>
<p>-Summary statement: “By healing a paralyzed man, Jesus demonstrated his authority to forgive sins as well as to heal.” -Explanatory comment: “Jesus heals a paralyzed man.” -Topical reference: “Cure of a paralytic.” -Question: &quot;Does Jesus have authority to heal and forgive sins?&quot; -&quot;About&quot; comment: &quot;About Jesus healing a paralyzed man.&quot;</p>
<p>What guidelines have you followed in writing names in the Bible? Do you use the names written in the national language Bible? Do you have guidelines from your own language as to how names are pronounced and if they need added titles? (Has this decision been acceptable to the community?)</p>
<p>Have you taken note of any spelling rules for your language that you would like to share with others, such as where a word changes its form or two words combine? (Are these rules acceptable to the community?)</p>

<p>We, the members of the translation team, affirm that we have checked the translation with members of the language community.</p>
<p>_____ We have checked the translation with old people and young people, and with men and women. _____ We used the comprehension questions when we checked the translation with the community. _____ We corrected the translation to make it clearer and easier to understand in the places where the community members did not understand it well.</p>
<p>Please also answer the following questions. The answers to these questions will help those in the wider Christian community know that the target language community finds the translation to be clear, accurate, and natural.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>List a few passages where the community feedback was helpful. How did you change these passages to make them clearer?</p></li>
<li><p>Write an explanation for some of the Important Terms, explaining how they are equal to terms used in the source language. This will help the checkers understand why you chose these terms.</p></li>
<li><p>Does the community verify that there is a good flow to the language when the passages are read out loud? (Does the language sound like the writer was a person from your own community?)</p></li>

<p>The community leaders might want to add their own information to this or make a summary statement about how acceptable this translation is to the local community. This can be included as part of the Level Two Community Check Evaluation information. The wider church leadership will have access to this information, and it will help them validate the translation as approved by the local Christian community when they do the Level Two Church check and also Level Three Checking.</p>
<p>Next we recommend you learn about: <a href="#church_leader_check">Church Leader Check</a><br></p>


<h1 id="church_leader_check">Church Leader Check</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How can the church leaders help improve the translation?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#level2">Checking Level Two – External Check</a><br></p>
<p>After the translation has been checked by community members for clarity, it will be checked by a group of church leaders for accuracy. This group must consist of at least three church leaders who are native speakers of the target language, and at least one of which understands well one of the languages in which the source text is available. They should not be related to, or otherwise closely connected with, the translator (or translation team). Usually these reviewers will be pastors of church congregations. These church leaders should represent the different churches in the language community. That is, it is best to include church leaders from different church networks. We recommend that the group include church leaders from three different church networks, if the community has that many.</p>
<p>These reviewers should follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the <a href="#statement_of_faith">Statement of Faith</a>and <a href="#translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</a>to make sure that the translation is in agreement with both of those as they review the translation.<br></li>
<li>Answer the questions about the translator or translation team that are located <a href="#qualifications">here</a>.<br></li>
<li>Verify that the translation communicates clearly and naturally by following the guidelines <a href="#clear">here</a>.<br></li>
<li>Verify that the translation has been done in a style that is acceptable to the intended audience by asking the questions <a href="#acceptable">here</a>.<br></li>
<li>Verify that the translation has been done using an appropriate alphabet by asking the questions <a href="#alphabet">here</a>.<br></li>
<li>Verify that the translation accurately communicates the meaning of the source text by following the guidelines <a href="#accurate">here</a>.<br></li>
<li>Verify that the translation is complete by following the guidelines <a href="#complete">here</a>.<br></li>
<li>After you have reviewed several chapters or one book of the Bible, meet with the translation team and ask about each problem. Discuss with the translation team how they might adjust the translation in order to fix the problems. Make plans to meet again with the translation team at a later time, after they have had time to adjust the translation and test it with the community.</li>
<li>Meet again with the translation team to verify that they have fixed the problems.</li>
<li>Affirm that the translation is good. Click <a href="#good">here</a> to do that on the Level Two Affirmation page.<br></li>
</ul>


<h1 id="qualifications">Translator Qualifications</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What are the qualifications of a translator?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#level1">Level One Check</a><br></p>
<h2>Questions about the Translator or Translation Team</h2>
<p>The Language Community Church Leaders will answer the following questions about the translator or translation team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the translator recognized as a qualified local language speaker?</li>
<li>Does the translator have adequate source language skills?</li>
<li><p>Is the translator respected in the community as a follower of Christ? These additional questions will help the community leaders know if the translators have sufficient understanding of the target language and culture and of the source language to be able to translate the Bible or the Open Bible Stories:</p></li>
<li>What is the age and local language background of each translator? (Has the translator been living in the local community for much of their life?)</li>
<li>Are they recognized as good speakers of their language by the local community? (Do people respect the way this person speaks their own language?)</li>
<li>What level of education have they received, and how have they obtained skills in the national language? (Does the Christian community recognize this person as having skills adequate to speak the national language and an education sufficient to use the exegetical helps provided?)</li>
<li>How long have they been a Christian, and are they in good standing with their Christian community? (How has this person shown themselves to be committed to Christ as a disciple? Are they respected in their Christian community?)</li>
<li><p>Does their work meet the expectations of their fellow translators and local church leaders? (Has the translator been willing to work with others in testing and checking their translation?)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Next we recommend you learn about: <a href="#clear">Clear Translation</a><br></p>


<h1 id="clear">Clear Translation</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How can I tell if the translation is clear?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#level1">Level One Check</a><br></p>
<h2>A Clear Translation</h2>
<p>Ask yourself questions like the following as you read the translation to see if the translated message is clear. For this section of testing, do not compare the new translation with the source language translation. If there is a problem at any place, make a note of it so that you can discuss the problem with the translation team at a later time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the words and phrases of the translation make the message understandable? (Are the words confusing, or do they tell you plainly what the translator means?)</li>
<li>Do your community members use the words and expressions found in the translation, or has the translator borrowed many words from the national language? (Is this the way your people talk when they want to say important things in your language?)</li>
<li>Can you read the text easily and understand what the writer might say next? (Is the translator using a good style of telling the story? Is he telling things in a way that makes sense, so that each section fits with what came before and what comes after?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional help:</p>
<p>One way to determine if the text is clear is to read a few verses at a time out loud and ask someone listening to retell the story after each section. If the person can easily restate your message, then the writing is clear. If there is a place where the translation is not clear, make a note of that so that you can discuss it with the translation team.</p>
<p>Next we recommend you learn about: <a href="#acceptable">Acceptable Style</a><br></p>


<h1 id="acceptable">Acceptable Style</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: Did the translatin team use an acceptabe style?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#clear">Clear Translation</a><br></p>
<h2>Translation in an Acceptable Style</h2>
<p>As you read the new translation, ask yourself these questions. These are questions that will help determine whether or not the translation has been done in a style that is acceptable to the language community:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the translation written in a way that can be understood easily by both young and old members of the language community? (Whenever someone speaks, they can change their choice of words for either a younger or an older audience. Is this translation done using words that communicate well to both young and old people?</li>
<li>Is the style of this translation more formal or informal? (Is the manner of speaking the way that the local community prefers, or should it be more or less formal?)</li>
<li>Does the translation use too many words that were borrowed from another language, or are these words acceptable to the language community?</li>
<li>Did the writer use an appropriate form of the language acceptable to the wider language community? (Is the writer familiar with the dialects of your language found throughout the area? Did the writer use a form of the language that all of the language community understands well, or did he use a form that is used in only a small area?</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a place where the translation uses language in the wrong style, make a note of that so that you can discuss it with the translation team.</p>
<p>Next we recommend you learn about: <a href="#alphabet">Appropriate Alphabet</a><br></p>


<h1 id="alphabet">Appropriate Alphabet</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: Does the translation use an appropriate alphabet?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#acceptable">Acceptable Style</a><br></p>
<h2>The Alphabet for the Translation</h2>
<p>As you read the translation, ask yourself these questions about the way words are spelled. These questions will help to determine if an appropriate alphabet has been chosen to represent the sounds of the language and if words have been written in a consistent way so that the translation will be easy to read.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the alphabet suitable to represent the sounds of the language of the new translation? (Are there any sounds that make a difference in meaning but have to use the same symbol as another sound? Does this make the words hard to read? Can additional marks be used to adjust these letters and show the differences?)</li>
<li>Is the spelling used in the book consistent? (Are there rules that the writer should follow to show how words change in different situations? Can they be described so others will know how to read and write the language easily?)</li>
<li>Has the writer used expressions, phrases, connectors, and spellings that will be recognized by most of the language community?</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is something about the alphabet or spelling that is not right, make a note of that so that you can discuss it with the translation team.</p>


<h1 id="accurate">Accurate Translation</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: Is the translation accurate?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#alphabet">Appropriate Alphabet</a><br></p>
<h2>An Accurate Translation</h2>
<p>The purpose of this section is to make sure that the new translation is accurate. In other words, when compared with the source translation, does the new translation communicate the same meaning (not necessarily with the same wording or the exact order)?</p>
<p>Read the sections of the translation again, and this time, compare it to the Bible in the source language. For this section of testing, the new translation must be compared with the source (national) language translation. You can do this by reading the new translation and then reading the same section in the source translation, or you can listen to someone read the new translation out loud, while silently reading the same section in the source translation. As you compare these, think about the following questions to see if the translator has made an accurate translation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was everything that was mentioned in the source language translation also mentioned in the flow of the new (local) translation? (Did the meaning of the new translation follow the message (not necessarily the wording) of the source translation? Sometimes if the arrangement of words or the order of ideas is different than in the source translation, it sounds better that way and is still accurate.)</li>
<li>Were the people introduced in each story doing the same things as those mentioned in the source language translation? (Was it easy to see who was doing the events of the new translation when it was compared to the source language?)</li>
<li>Are there Important Terms used in the new translation that do not match your understanding of the words in the source version? (Think about things like this: How do your people talk about a priest (one who sacrifices to God) or a temple (the sacrifice place of the Jews) without using a word borrowed from the source language?)</li>
<li>Are the phrases used in the new translation helpful in understanding the more difficult phrases of the source translation? (Are the phrases of the new translation put together in a way that brings better understanding and still fit with the meaning of the source language translation?)</li>
<li>Another way to determine if the text is accurate is to ask comprehension questions about the translation, such as, “who did what, when, where, how, and why.” For questions about Open Bible Stories, click here. For questions about the Bible, click here. The answers to those questions should be the same as the answers to those questions about the source language translation. If they are not, there is a problem in the translation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a place where the translation is not accurate, make a note of that so that you can discuss it with the translation team.</p>
<p>Next we recommend you learn about: <a href="#complete">Complete Translation</a><br></p>


<h1 id="complete">Complete Translation</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: Is the translation complete?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#accurate">Accurate Translation</a><br></p>
<h2>A Complete Translation</h2>
<p>The purpose of this section is to make sure that the translation is complete. In this section, the new translation must be compared to the source translation. As you compare the two translations, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the translation missing any of its parts? In other words, does the translation include all the events of the book that was translated?</li>
<li>Does the translation include all the verses of the book that was translated? (When you look at the verse numbering of the source language translation, are all of the verses included in the target language translation?) Sometimes there are differences in verse numbering between translations. For example, in some translations some verses are grouped together or sometimes certain verses are put in footnotes. Even though there may be these kinds of differences between the source translation and the target translation, the target translation is still considered to be complete.</li>
<li>Are there places in the translation where something seems to be left out, or there seems to be a different message than is found in the source language translation? (The wording and the order can be different, but the language that the translator used should give the same message as the source language translation.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a place where the translation is not complete, make a note of that so that you can discuss it with the translation team.</p>
<p>Next we recommend you learn about: <a href="#good">Affirmation</a><br></p>

<h1 id="level3">Checking Level Three - Authenticated Check</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How do I do a level 3 check?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#intro_levels">Introduction to the Checking Levels</a><br></p>
<p>Level Three checking will be done by groups or organizations that are recognized by the churches in a language community. These groups will verify that they approve of the distribution and use of the translation among the people affiliated with them. This approval is not required for distribution of the translation, but rather serves to validate it.</p>
<p>Level Three checking can be achieved by following either of two tracks. For Track One, the checking will be done by at least three church networks, and for Track Two, the checking will be done by at least one church network and by a recognized Bible translation agency. Those who do Level Three checking need to be other than the people who did Level Two checking.</p>
<h3>Level Three, Track One (Three Church Networks)</h3>
<p>The first track is completed when the content has been thoroughly checked by representatives of at least three separate Church networks. The Church networks should be representative of the churches in the language community. Those checking the translation must be first-language speakers of the language, and those signing off on the check must be in leadership roles in the Church networks. A leader of a Church network who is also a first-language speaker of the language of the translation may both check the translation and sign off on its quality. Level Three in this track is thus achieved by the mutual agreement of multiple elements of the Church internal.</p>
<h3>Level Three, Track Two (Trained Translation Checker + One Church Network)</h3>
<p>The second track is completed when the content has been thoroughly checked by an accountable Bible translation entity in the unfoldingWord network that has training and experience in checking translated biblical content, as well as by representatives of a Church network recognized by the language community. Those checking the translation for the Church network must be first-language speakers of the language and whoever signs off on the check must be in a leadership role in the Church network (as described in the first track). Level Three in this track is thus achieved by the mutual agreement of the Church internal and the Church global, as represented by the accountable Bible translation entity.</p>
<p>In either track, the checking entities must have a track record that does not contradict their assertion that they adhere to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines.</p>
<p>To proceed with Level Three checking, Level Three checkers will click on the link below and answer the questions found on that page:</p>
<p><a href="#level3_questions">Go to the Level Three checking questions</a>.<br></p>
<p>Next we recommend you learn about: <a href="#level3_questions">Questions for Checking on Level Three</a><br></p>


<h1 id="level3_questions">Questions for Checking on Level Three</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What do I look for in a level 3 check?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#level3">Checking Level Three - Authenticated Check</a><br></p>
<h4>These are the questions for the Level Three checkers to keep in mind as they read the new translation.</h4>
<p>You can answer these questions after you read portions of the translation or as you come across problems in the text. If you answer &quot;no&quot; to any of these questions in the first group, please explain in more detail, include the specific passage that you feel is not right, and give your recommendation for how the translation team should correct it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the goal of the translation team is to express the meaning of the source text in a natural and clear way in the target language. This means that they may have needed to change the order of some clauses and that they had to represent many single words in the source language with multiple words in the target language. These things are not considered to be problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the translation conform to the Statement of Faith and Translation Guidelines?</li>
<li>Did the translation team show a good understanding of the source language as well as the target language and culture?</li>
<li>Does the language community affirm that the translation speaks in a clear and natural way in their language?</li>
<li>Which of the following translation styles did the translators appear to follow?
<ul>
<li>Word by word translation, staying very close to the form of the source translation.</li>
<li>Phrase by phrase translation, using natural language phrase structures.</li>
<li>Meaning-focused translation, aiming for a freedom of local language expression.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do the community leaders feel that the style that the translators followed (as identified in question 4) is appropriate for the community?</li>
<li>Do the community leaders feel that the dialect that the translators used is the best one to communicate to the wider language community? For example, have the translators used expressions, phrase connectors, and spellings that will be recognized by most people in the language community?</li>
<li>As you read the translation, think about cultural issues in the local community that might make some passages in the book difficult to translate. Has the translation team translated these passages in a way that makes the message of the source text clear, and avoids any misunderstanding that people might have because of the cultural issue?</li>
<li>In these difficult passages, do the community leaders feel that the translator has used language that communicates the same message that is in the source text?</li>
<li>In your judgment, does the translation communicate the same message as the source text? If any part of the translation causes you to answer &quot;no,&quot; please answer the second group of questions below.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you answer &quot;yes&quot; to any of the questions in this second group, please explain in more detail so that the translation team can know what the specific problem is, what part of the text needs correction, and how you would like them to correct it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any doctrinal errors in the translation?</li>
<li>Did you find any areas of the translation that seem to contradict the national language translation or the important matters of faith found in your Christian community?</li>
<li>Did the translation team add extra information or ideas that were not part of the message in the source text?</li>
<li>Did the translation team leave out information or ideas that were part of the message in the source text?</li>
</ul>
<p>If there were problems with the translation, make plans to meet with the translation team and resolve these problems. After you meet with them, the translation team may need to check their revised translation with the community leaders to make sure that it still communicates well, and then meet with you again.</p>

<p>This module answers the question: How do I create a keyboard in tK?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about: <a href="#tk_intro">translationKeyboard</a><br></p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<ul>
<li>Decide on the language you want to make a keyboard for</li>
<li>Go to: tk.unfoldingword.org/users/sign_in</li>
<li>Sign in using your username and password</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keyboard Search</h3>
<p>Search through the keyboards already available to ensure the language has not been created or started. Three possibilities are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>The keyboard has been created already, you are done!</li>
<li><p>If the keyboard has been started and not finished, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait to see if it is in progress and wait for the completion, or</li>
<li>Continue the keyboard and complete it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If the desired keyboard is not available, the following suggestions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the requestor for more information about the keyboard/language desired specifics; such as the symbols needed for the keyboard</li>
<li>Search for existing keyboards using a search engine</li>
<li>Create a similar, but different keyboard using the information obtained through research.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Or</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a Unicode or UTF website with the correct symbols.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then:</p>
<h3>Create or Edit a Keyboard in tK</h3>
<p>At <a href="http://tk.unfoldingword.org/">http://tk.unfoldingword.org/</a>, select the keyboard that is desired if available, or select the “Create New Keyboard”* button at the top of the web page:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>A new window titled “Create New Keyboard” will appear.</li>
<li>Type the name of the keyboard language in the Keyboard name box</li>
<li>Pick the ISO Language Code by typing the first three to five letters of the language desired and pick the appropriate code from the list, this should fill in the ISO Region Code.</li>
<li>Keyboard Type: Most keyboards the Android 4 row will work, but the 5 row and IOS are also available.</li>
<li>Press “Go”
<ul>
<li>Note: If the Keyboard has already been added, select the appropriate keyboard from the “Languages with Keyboards” list or “Recently Updated Keyboards” list.</li>
<li>Note: There are plus “+” and “-“ keys at the end of each row. These keys allow more character keys to be added or deleted from each row.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>Edit or Add Symbols to a Keyboard</h3>
<p>In the next window, press the “Edit Keyboard” button in the top, right corner of the screen.</p>
<p>In the beginning, these boxes will be blank until they are filled the selected symbol, UTF or Unicode selection.</p>
<h3>Input the Symbols of the Desired Language in tK</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pick the key to be edited by selecting it with the mouse button</li>
<li>Select the Default and Shift characters desired or the corresponding UTF-8 or Unicode string for the character.</li>
<li>Press “Save Changes”</li>
<li>If additional characters are desired for that key
<ul>
<li>Select the key again and press the “Longpress Character” key once for each additional character desired. You will not be able to enter characters into the long keys until the long key boxes are saved.</li>
<li>Go back and enter the desired character or UTF-8 or Unicode string.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Press “Save Changes”</strong></li>
<li>Note: Unicode U+00xx usually translates to UTF-8 “xx”. For example: Unicode “U+0d38” is equal to UTF-8 “d38”. ADD: If you can find the correct unicode chart or symbol set for the language, you may be able to copy and paste symbols or codes from a Word document, Excel spreadsheet or Adobe PDF file into the keyboard keys in the &quot;Edit&quot; mode.</li>

<h3>Statement of Faith</h3>
<p>The <a href="#statement_of_faith">Statement of Faith</a> is subscribed to by all member organizations of and contributors to the unfoldingWord project. It is in agreement with the Lausanne Covenant.<br></p>
<h3>Translation Guidelines</h3>
<p>The specific steps involved may vary significantly, depending on the language and context of the translation project. Generally, we consider a good translation to be one that is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Accurate</strong> - Faithful to the intended meaning of the original, as determined by the Church in that people group and in alignment with the Church global and historical, and consequently:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Affirmed by the Church</strong> - Endorsed and used by the Church. Read the information on the <strong><a href="#translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</a></strong> page to learn the best way to translate the stories.<br> If you agree with the Statement of Faith and intend to follow the Translation Guidelines, then begin translating the source text into the language you selected.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Use the Translation Notes Pages</h3>
<p>You can click here to go to <a href="https://door43.org/en/obs/notes/31">Jesus Walks on Water</a> story with translation helps.<br> This <a href="http://youtu.be/5fFl8crhglE">video</a> (1 minute 20 seconds) will give a quick overview of how to use the Translation Notes on the story picture pages.<br></p>
<ul>
<li>The stories are separated into separate pages by the pictures (called frames).</li>
<li>Each page has the picture and the text, in a national trade language, from the story.</li>
<li>There are bold words in the text. These are very important words that need to be translated correctly. Click on the bold word to go to another page that will give more information on how to translate the very important word.</li>
<li>Translation Notes explains how to translate some of the important words in the story. The definition of the word or phrase should help you understand how to translate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Translate from the Source Language</h3>
<p>It is best to open the webpage of the story in your language and the webpage of the story with Translation Notes. This <a href="http://youtu.be/73tAlcffiLU">video</a> (10 minutes) will give a quick overview of how to use the Translation Notes when translating. The Translation Notes pages are designed to help write accurate translations.<br> The video assumes you understand the above instructions. The video uses the graphical editor. Here is a summary of the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find stories in your heart language that have not been translated that you want to work on.</li>
<li>Open the Translation Notes in a new window and arrange the windows side-by-side.</li>
<li>Have both the <a href="https://door43.org/en/obs/notes/01">Translation Notes</a> and the Heart Language windows on the same story.<br></li>
<li>In the Translation Notes window note the Picture or Frame Number (number in [ ] after the story title).</li>
<li>Open the graphical (CKG Edit) editor in the heart language window and scroll down to the desired frame. Compare the picture .</li>
<li>Read the Notes for help on how to translate some of the words and terms. <strong>Once you have chosen the correct words or terms in your language, arrange the translated words so they make sense and the stories are easy to read and understand.</strong></li>
<li>Continue editing frames and saving your work.</li>
<li>Enjoy and share the new translation.</li>

<h1 id="process_manual">Introduction to the Process Manual</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is the Process Manual?</p>
<p>Before you start this module have you learned about:</p>
<p>The Process Manual is a practical guide to help translation teams know what steps need to be taken from start to finish and how those steps are to be taken. While the Translation Manual is a how-to guide for translation theory and the Checking Manual is a how-to guide for checking theory and the Technology Manual is a how-to guide for using certain technology pieces, the Process Manual seeks to give a step-by-step process the translation team can follow. The Process Manual guides the translation team from initial setup to final publishing of translated and checked content.</p>

<h1 id="prechecking_training">Training Before Checking Begins</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What should I know about checking before I begin?</p>
<h4>Before Checking</h4>
<p>It is recommended that you consult the <a href="#toc_checkvol1_2">Checking Manual</a> frequently as you check this content. Before you start checking, we recommend that you start working your way through the Checking Manual until you understand what is required at each level. As you work through the checking process, you will need to consult the Checking Manual frequently. <br></p>
<p>Note: Content will not be published to the unfoldingWord website or mobile app until it has attained at least checking level 1.</p>


<h1 id="required_checking">How to Check</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How do I check a translation?</p>
<h4>Purpose of Checking Levels</h4>
<p>The purpose the <a href="#toc_checkvol1_2">checking levels</a> is primarily to help ensure that the translation has been made in accordance with the <a href="#statement_of_faith">Statement of Faith</a> and the <a href="#translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</a>. Another purpose for the checking levels is to increase the input and ownership of the translation among the community that will be using it. <br></p>
<h4>Checking Level 1</h4>
<p><a href="#level1">Checking Level 1</a> is done primarily by the translation team, with some input from the language community. <br></p>
<p>Please follow the <a href="#level1">Steps for checking under Level One</a> to complete a Level 1 check. <br></p>
<p>After completing the Level 1 Check, you are encouraged to <a href="#intro_publishing">publish</a> your translation and continue on to Checking Level 2 (see below). <br></p>
<h4>Checking Level 2</h4>
<p><a href="#level2">Checking Level 2</a> is done to verify that representative groups from the local language community agree that the translation is a good one. It is done with a <a href="#language_community_check">language community check</a> and a <a href="#church_leader_check">church leader check</a>. <br></p>
<p>After completing the Level 2 Check, you are encouraged to <a href="#intro_publishing">publish</a> your translation and continue on to Checking Level 3 (see below), if you so desire. <br></p>
<h4>Checking Level 3</h4>
<p><a href="#level3">Checking Level 3</a> has two possible tracks: track one requires church networks to approve the translation and track two requires one church network and one trained translation consultant. Be sure you work through the <a href="#level3_questions">Level 3 Checking Questions</a> while you complete this checking level. <br></p>
<p>After completing the Level 3 Check, you are encouraged to <a href="#intro_publishing">publish</a> your translation. This is the highest checking level. <br></p>


<h1 id="intro_publishing">Introduction to Publishing</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What is publishing?</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>There are two translation platforms that we use - translationStudio and Door43. Once translations have been completed, we encourage these translations to be checked. Once a translation has been checked to at least Level 1, it becomes eligible to be published. Published content is placed on a platform where it remains static. While the content on Door43 can change frequently, the published content is static and assurance of quality remains high.</p>
<p>When content is published, a copy of what is found on Door43 is published to the <a href="https://unfoldingword.org/stories">unfoldingWord website</a> in several formats:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>To be viewed online</li>
<li>In a print-ready PDF for Print-on-Demand</li>
<li>On the free <a href="https://unfoldingword.org/app">unfoldingWord mobile app</a> for offline consumption<br></li>
</ul>
<h3>Publishable Content</h3>
<p>Presently, there are two text resources that can be published using the unfoldingWord publishing engine:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://door43.org/en/obs">Open Bible Stories</a><br></li>
<li><a href="https://door43.org/en/bible/intro">the Bible</a><br></li>
</ul>
<p>Capacity is being built to be able to handle multimedia formats as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio Open Bible Stories</li>
<li>Video Open Bible Stories</li>
<li>Audio Bible</li>
</ul>
<h3>Published Content</h3>
<p>Published content can be found at https://unfoldingword.org/stories/ and on the <a href="https://unfoldingword.org/app">unfoldingWord mobile app</a>. <br></p>
<p>In Door43, a brief statement will appear in resources that may be eligible for publishing which states the status of publishing in that namespace. For instance, at the time of writing the <a href="https://door43.org/en/obs">Open Bible Stories in English</a> says &quot;This resource is published on unfoldingWord as checking level 3 and version 4. See it at https://unfoldingword.org/stories.&quot;<br></p>


<h1 id="publishing_prereqs">Publishing Prerequisites</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: What must be done before publishing?</p>
<h3>Before Publishing</h3>
<p>Before a resource can be published, the following prerequisites must all be met:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Whole Resource</strong> - The whole resource must be translated and checked, in other words, parts of resources (e.g. half of the Open Bible Stories, only a few chapters of a book of the Bible) cannot be published.</li>
<li><strong>At Least Level 1</strong> - A translation must have reached at least <a href="#level1">Checking Level 1</a><br></li>
<li><strong>On Door43</strong> - Door43 must have the version that will be published (if translation or checking was done in translationStudio, you may need to <a href="#upload_merge">merge</a> your work into Door43). <br></li>
<li><p><strong>Signatures</strong> - Everyone involved in the translation and checking must have signed the <a href="#statement_of_faith">Statement of Faith</a>, the <a href="#translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</a>, and the <a href="#open_license">Open License</a>. This can be done in a number of ways:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone create a Door43 account</li>
<li>Everyone sign a <a href="https://unfoldingword.org/forms">guidelines and license form</a><br></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>When all these are completed, you are ready to start the <a href="#publishing_process">Publishing Engine</a>. <br></p>


<h1 id="publishing_process">How to Publish</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How do I publish my content?</p>
<h3>Starting the Publishing Process</h3>
<p>Before you start the Publishing Process, please be sure that you have met all the <a href="#publishing_prereqs">Publishing Prerequisites</a>. <br></p>
<p>To start the publishing process, someone from the team will need fill out the <a href="http://td.unfoldingword.org/publishing/publish/request/">Request to Publish Form</a>. A few things to note about this form: <br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An email address is required</strong> - During the publishing process, the requester will be emailed if there are any problems, and also at the end of the process, requesting a final check be made.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation of Contributors is required</strong> - To document who was involved, each Checking Level requires that all contributors sign the <a href="#statement_of_faith">Statement of Faith</a>, the <a href="#translation_guidelines">Translation Guidelines</a>, and the <a href="#open_license">Open License</a>. This documentation is required to start the publishing process. <br>
<ul>
<li>Note: To help protect the identity of those who might desire it, pseudonyms/usernames will be cited (if provided) rather than real names in the list of contributors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>A &quot;pre-flight&quot; check</strong> - Immediately after submitting the Request to Publish form, a computerized check will take place. This check ensures that everything has been translated and that content appears in the correct web pages in Door43. It also does a statistical check which compares the standard deviation from the source language to the target langauge. Abnormally high or low deviations are flagged and all results of the &quot;pre-flight&quot; check are processed and returned to the requester within a minute or so. If any changes need to be made, they should be made before proceeding.</li>
</ul>
<h3>During the Publishing Process</h3>
<p>After the Request to Publish form has been submitted, the following will happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A documentation check</strong> - someone from the unfoldingWord team will check to make sure all the documentation is in place and that the procedures followed during the checking process correspond to the guidelines laid out in the <a href="https://unfoldingword.org/quality/">Checking Levels</a>. <br></li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the documentation is not correct, the requester will be emailed and the publishing process will stop until the problem is resolved and a &quot;Request to Continue Publishing&quot; form is filled out and submitted.</p>
<h3>Finishing the Publishing Process</h3>
<p>When the publishing process is complete, the content will be published to the unfoldingWord catalogue which makes it available on the <a href="http://unfoldingword.org/stories">unfoldingWord website</a> as a print-ready PDF and viewable online. It will also be published to the <a href="https://unfoldingword.org/app/">unfoldingWord mobile app</a>. (In order for this newly published content to appear on your unfoldingWord app, you may need to download the latest content from the web.)<br></p>
<p>The requester will be emailed and informed that the publishing process has been completed and they will be requested to look over the published content to ensure that everything &quot;looks right.&quot;</p>


<h1 id="intro_share">Introduction to Distribution</h1>
<p>This module answers the question: How can I distribute content?</p>
<h3>Distribution Overview</h3>
<p>Content is worthless unless it is disseminated and used. One advantage of using the Door43/unfoldingWord translation and publishing platform is that it provides multiple, simple ways of distributing both published and unpublished content.</p>
<h3>Open License</h3>
