        <div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><h2>Every Language</h2>

          <p>We create Biblical content and technology tools that are effective for every language, without exception.
            If we design a tool or resource that is not able to go the distance to the heart language of the last and
            smallest people group, we have not yet designed it correctly.</p>
          <blockquote><p>And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go
              therefore and make disciples of all people groups, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son
              and of the Holy Spirit&#8221; —Matthew 28:19</p></blockquote>
          <h2>Excellence</h2>

          <p>The unfoldingWord project is built on a firm commitment to the faithful and accurate communication of God’s
            Word. The degree of rigor involved in the checking process of each work is clearly indicated with the intent
            that ongoing review and checking will iteratively increase the excellence of each work.</p>
          <blockquote><p>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be
              ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. —2 Timothy 2:15</p></blockquote>
          <h2>Always Open</h2>

          <p>Everything we create, whether Biblical content or technology tools, is made available under a license that
            proactively grants the entire Church unrestricted freedom to use and build on it, without requiring
            additional permission.</p>
          <blockquote><p>Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and&#8230; they had
              everything in common. —Acts 4:32</p></blockquote>
          <h2>Unstoppable</h2>

          <p>Our strategies and technical frameworks are intentionally designed to encourage and enable massive
            redistribution of Biblical content by the entire global Church, in and to every people group. We avoid
            single points of failure and centralized structures by using parallel, redundant, and distributed
            technologies.</p>
          <blockquote><p>After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every people
              group, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed
              in white robes, with palm branches in their hands. —Revelation 7:9</p></blockquote>
